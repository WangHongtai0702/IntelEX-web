{"result": "SMB (Server Message Block) is a network file sharing protocol that allows applications to read and write to files and request services from server programs in a computer network. It is used for providing shared access to files, printers, and serial ports between nodes on a network. SMB operates over ports 139/TCP and 445/TCP, making it a commonly targeted management service for password guessing attacks. Additionally, adversaries may use SMB for internal connections within an enclave, and it can be utilized by internal proxy connections to blend in with the environment.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
