{"result": "\"ACTIVE SCANNING\" is a reconnaissance technique used by adversaries to gather information about a target's network or systems through active probing. This direct collection action involves scanning networks to identify potential targets and gather detailed information about network topologies, host software, listening ports, server banners, user agent strings, hostnames, client configurations, and network security appliances. Adversaries use Active Scanning to probe and analyze responses from authentication services, which can reveal valid usernames or multi-factor authentication (MFA) methods. This technique is employed to collect data directly from a target's systems or networks, including victim domains and their properties.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
