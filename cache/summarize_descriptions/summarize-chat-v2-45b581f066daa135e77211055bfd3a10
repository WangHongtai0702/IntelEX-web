{"result": "Asymmetric Cryptography, also known as public key cryptography, is a cryptographic technique that uses a pair of keys (public and private) for secure communication. This method involves each party having a keypair: one public key that can be freely distributed and one private key that is kept secret. Asymmetric Cryptography is commonly used to encrypt command and control (C2) traffic, often in conjunction with web protocols, ensuring secure and confidential communication.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
