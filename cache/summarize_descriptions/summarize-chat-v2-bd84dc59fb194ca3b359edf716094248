{"result": "CREDENTIALS are authentication data used to verify the identity of users or systems. This data typically includes details such as usernames and passwords. Adversaries may target credentials to gain unauthorized access to systems, often acquiring them through insecure storage, malicious browser extensions, or by purchasing access. Once obtained, adversaries may use these credentials to conduct cyber attacks or modify them to maintain persistent access. Additionally, credentials can be gathered from various sources, including the proc filesystem and purchased data.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
