{"result": "\"Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol\" is a technique used by adversaries to transfer exfiltrated information out of a network using non-standard or alternative protocols. This method involves stealing data by exfiltrating it over a different protocol than that of the existing command and control channel. It is a sophisticated approach where data is exfiltrated using alternative protocols, making it harder to detect and prevent.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
