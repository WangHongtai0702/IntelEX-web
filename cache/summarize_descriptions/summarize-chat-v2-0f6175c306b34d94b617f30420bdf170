{"result": "MULTI-HOP PROXY is a technique used by adversaries to achieve command and control by routing traffic through multiple proxies. This method involves modifying the operating system to add new capabilities to the device, enabling it to route traffic through several intermediary proxies. This multi-layered approach helps adversaries obscure their activities and maintain a more secure and resilient command and control infrastructure.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
