{"result": "Asymmetric encryption, also known as public-key cryptography, is a type of encryption that uses different keys on each end of the communication channel. This method involves using distinct keys for encryption and decryption. Typically, asymmetric encryption is employed to securely exchange keys, after which symmetric encryption may be used for the actual data transmission.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
