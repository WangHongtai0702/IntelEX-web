{"result": "Dynamic Linker Hijacking is a technique used by adversaries to load malicious libraries by hijacking environment variables. This method involves manipulating the dynamic linker/loader to insert environment variables, thereby enabling the loading of malicious code into a target process. By exploiting this technique, attackers can achieve persistence within a system, ensuring their malicious code is executed whenever the compromised process is initiated.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
