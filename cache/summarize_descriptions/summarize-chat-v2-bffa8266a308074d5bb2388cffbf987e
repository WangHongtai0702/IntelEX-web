{"result": "EXTERNAL REMOTE SERVICES refer to services that allow remote access to a system or network, which can be exploited by adversaries to gain initial access. These services, such as VPNs, remote desktop protocols (RDP), and other remote access tools, are often targeted by adversaries for brute force attacks and can be used to establish and maintain access to compromised systems. This technique involves exploiting remote services that are accessible from outside the target network, often using information gathered from active scans. The exploitation of these services can create artifacts in system and application logs, which can be used for cyber reconnaissance. Adversaries may use gathered credentials to gain initial access through these services, making it a critical method for initial access in cyber attacks.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
