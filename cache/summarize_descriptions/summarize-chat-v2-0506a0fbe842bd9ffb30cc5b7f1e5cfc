{"result": "SMB/Windows Admin Shares are network file sharing protocols used in Windows operating systems for transferring files between systems. These shares are often utilized for RPC communication and typically require valid accounts for access. Adversaries frequently exploit SMB/Windows Admin Shares as a technique to propagate malware across a network by leveraging shared administrative resources. This lateral movement technique involves accessing shared resources on Windows systems, often using commands like `net use`, to move laterally through systems. SMB/Windows Admin Shares are also known to be used by ransomware to spread across a network, making them a critical vector for network-based attacks.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
