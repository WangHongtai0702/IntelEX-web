{"result": "Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is a security mechanism that requires users to provide multiple forms of verification to gain access to a resource. This process enhances security by demanding more than just a username and password, incorporating additional verification methods such as smart cards and token generators. By requiring multiple forms of verification, MFA provides a higher level of security compared to traditional single-factor authentication methods.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
