{"result": "\"Obtain Capabilities\" is a process and technique used by adversaries to acquire the necessary tools, resources, and techniques for their operations, often from external sources. This activity is crucial for threat actors as it enables them to enhance their attack capabilities and gather information about network security appliances. By obtaining these tools, tactics, and procedures, adversaries can effectively establish operational resources and conduct cyber attacks. This process can also be supported by information gathered from active scans.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
