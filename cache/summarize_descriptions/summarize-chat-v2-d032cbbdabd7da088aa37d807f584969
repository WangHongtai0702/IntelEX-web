{"result": "VNC (Virtual Network Computing) is a graphical desktop-sharing system that uses the Remote Frame Buffer protocol to remotely control another computer. It is a remote access software commonly used for legitimate technical support and may be allowed by application control within a target environment. VNC operates over port 5900/TCP and is a commonly targeted management service for password guessing attacks. Additionally, VNC can be used externally for remote desktop connections.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
