{"result": "Spearphishing Attachment is a technique used in internal spearphishing to deliver a payload. It involves adversaries sending emails with malicious attachments to gain code execution and access to a user's system. This method is commonly used to spread malware, such as Ursnif. The technique often includes embedding VBA content within the attachments to deliver malicious payloads to targets. By tricking users into executing harmful files, adversaries can compromise the recipient's system.
