{"result": "Patch System Image is a technique employed by adversaries to manipulate the operating system of network and embedded devices for various malicious purposes. This technique can be used in conjunction with downgrading the system image to evade defenses. Adversaries may change the operating system to implement their own custom Network Address Translation (NAT) mechanisms, which helps obscure their activities. Additionally, they can hard code a password into the operating system, thereby bypassing native authentication mechanisms for local accounts on network devices. Patch System Image also enables the modification of network devices to facilitate traffic redirection. Furthermore, adversaries may add custom code to routers to implement onion routing between nodes, enhancing their ability to conceal their network traffic.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
