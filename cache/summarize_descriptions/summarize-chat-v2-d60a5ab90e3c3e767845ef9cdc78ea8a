{"result": "Internal Spearphishing is a cyber attack technique where adversaries send deceptive and malicious emails within an organization. This targeted phishing attack involves the use of compromised business accounts to send phishing messages to other internal users. The primary goal is to deceive employees into executing malicious actions, thereby compromising additional accounts or gaining access to sensitive information. Adversaries often impersonate internal employees to enhance the credibility of their phishing attempts. Internal Spearphishing is typically a multi-staged campaign, beginning with the compromise of a legitimate account, which is then used to further infiltrate the organization's network.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
