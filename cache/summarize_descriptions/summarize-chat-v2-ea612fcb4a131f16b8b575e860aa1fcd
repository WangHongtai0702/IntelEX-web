{"result": "LAUNCH DAEMON is a macOS component and service that manages the execution of daemons, including emond, and can be configured to execute with root privileges. It is a mechanism used to run scripts or programs as root at system startup or at specified times, having replaced login hooks in macOS version 10.11. This process runs to finish system initialization and load user-specific parameters. Additionally, it is a technique where adversaries might run additional commands for persistence.
