{"result": "FTP (File Transfer Protocol) is a standard network protocol used for the transfer of computer files between a client and server on a computer network. It is commonly used to transfer files between systems and is a utility often available with operating systems for this purpose. FTP operates over port 21/TCP and is a commonly targeted management service for password guessing attacks. While FTP is not typically encrypted, it may be encrypted using symmetric cryptographic algorithms. Additionally, FTP can be exploited by adversaries to transfer files from an external adversary-controlled system to the victim network or to download new files to network devices, potentially changing the operating system in storage.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
