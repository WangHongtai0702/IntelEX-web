{"result": "DLL Search Order Hijacking is a technique where adversaries exploit the order in which Windows searches for Dynamic Link Libraries (DLLs) to load malicious code. By manipulating the search order for loading DLLs, adversaries can ensure that their malicious code is executed by the operating system or a program. This technique takes advantage of the way the operating system prioritizes the loading of DLLs, allowing the adversaries to insert their malicious DLLs into the search path, thereby executing their code instead of the legitimate DLLs.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
