{"result": "SYMMETRIC ENCRYPTION is a type of encryption where the same key is used for both encryption and decryption. This method involves using shared or identical keys/secrets on each end of the communication channel to secure data. It is often employed after keys are exchanged in asymmetric encryption protocols, ensuring that both parties can encrypt and decrypt the information using the same key.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
