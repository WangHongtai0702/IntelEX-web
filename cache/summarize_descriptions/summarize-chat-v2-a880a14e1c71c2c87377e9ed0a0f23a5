{"result": "HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is an application protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems. It is the foundation of any data exchange on the Web and is used for transmitting hypermedia documents, such as HTML. HTTP operates over ports 80/TCP and 443/TCP and is commonly targeted for password guessing attacks. While HTTP is not typically encrypted, it can be encrypted using symmetric cryptographic algorithms.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
