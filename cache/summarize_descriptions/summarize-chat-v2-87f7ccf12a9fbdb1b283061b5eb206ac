{"result": "SPEARPHISHING LINK is a specific type of phishing technique where adversaries send targeted emails containing malicious links. This method is used to gain information or initial access by redirecting the recipient to an external site designed to capture credentials. Often employed in internal spearphishing campaigns, SPEARPHISHING LINK can also be used in OAuth phishing attacks, where the target user is enticed to grant access to an application. Additionally, adversaries may use this technique to exploit web browsers by directing users to adversary-controlled sites. Through social engineering, they manipulate users into clicking on these malicious links, which can lead to code execution.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
