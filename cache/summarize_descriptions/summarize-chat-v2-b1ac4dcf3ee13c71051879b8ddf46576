{"result": "TLS (Transport Layer Security) is a network protocol that employs both asymmetric and symmetric encryption methods. Initially, TLS uses asymmetric cryptography to establish or transmit a key securely. Once the keys are exchanged, the protocol then utilizes symmetric cryptography to encrypt the data transmitted over the connection. This combination ensures both secure key exchange and efficient data encryption.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
