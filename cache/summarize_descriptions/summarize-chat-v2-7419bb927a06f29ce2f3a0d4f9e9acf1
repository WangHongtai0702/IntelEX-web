{"result": "\"Phishing for Information\" is a cyber attack technique where adversaries attempt to obtain sensitive information by disguising themselves as trustworthy entities. This method is used in reconnaissance to gather information directly from victims through deceptive means, often involving fraudulent emails or messages. Adversaries may use this technique to gather credentials for compromising various accounts, including social media and cloud accounts, as well as to collect information about network security appliances, network topologies, and network trusts. The technique involves tricking individuals into revealing sensitive data, which can include personal information, credentials, or details about victim domains and their properties. Phishing for Information can be supported by AI tools to enhance the effectiveness of these deceptive communications.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
