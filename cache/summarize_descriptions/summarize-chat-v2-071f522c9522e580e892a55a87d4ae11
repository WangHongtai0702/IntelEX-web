{"result": "Adversaries aim to execute malicious code by exploiting various aspects of the operating system. They modify component firmware to run their code outside of the operating system's usual controls. Additionally, adversaries exploit the operating system's handling of file extensions and vulnerabilities to execute adversary-controlled code.
