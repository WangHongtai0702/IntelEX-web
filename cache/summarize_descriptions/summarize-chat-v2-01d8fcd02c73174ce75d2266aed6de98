{"result": "The Registry is a hierarchical database in Windows operating systems that stores low-level settings for the operating system and for applications that opt to use the Registry. It includes configuration settings and options, such as environment variables like COR_PROFILER, local service configurations, and references to various COM objects and other system settings. The Registry can be modified by adversaries to include malicious payloads or to add malicious applications to the list of services that start in safe mode.
