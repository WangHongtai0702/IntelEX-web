{"result": "SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) is a standard security technology for establishing an encrypted link between a server and a client. It is a network protocol that initially uses asymmetric cryptography to establish or transmit a key. Once the keys are exchanged, SSL often utilizes symmetric encryption to secure the data transmitted over the connection. This combination of asymmetric and symmetric encryption ensures both the secure exchange of keys and the efficient encryption of data during the session.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
