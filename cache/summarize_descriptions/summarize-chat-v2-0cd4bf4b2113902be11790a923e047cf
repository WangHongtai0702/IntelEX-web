{"result": "Lateral Movement consists of techniques that adversaries use to enter and control remote systems on a network. This phase involves moving through a network to gain access to additional systems, data, and resources. Adversaries often use compromised credentials to pivot through multiple systems and accounts, aiming to find key data and assets. After gaining initial access, attackers employ various methods to move deeper into the network, sometimes using specific utilities like the 'at' utility to run processes under the context of specified accounts. This tactic is also utilized by certain malware, such as the Samurai backdoor, to facilitate movement within a network. Overall, Lateral Movement is a critical step for adversaries to expand their control and gather valuable information within a compromised network.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
