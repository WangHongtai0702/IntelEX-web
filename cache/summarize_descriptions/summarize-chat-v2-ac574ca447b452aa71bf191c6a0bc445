{"result": "RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) is a proprietary protocol developed by Microsoft that provides a user with a graphical interface to connect to another computer over a network connection. It is commonly used for remote desktop connections and is integral to Microsoft Terminal Services, which transmits a graphical user interface to clients. RDP operates over port 3389/TCP and is frequently targeted for password guessing attacks. Additionally, adversaries may exploit RDP for internal connections within an enclave or by adding new firewall rules to gain unauthorized access to computers.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
