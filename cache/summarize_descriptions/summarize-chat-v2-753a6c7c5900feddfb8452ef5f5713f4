{"result": "Adversary-in-the-Middle (AiTM) is a technique where adversaries intercept and manipulate communications between two parties who believe they are directly communicating with each other. This attack method involves intercepting information transmitted over secure communications, often using atypical root certificates, and can include the injection of malicious content. AiTM can be enabled by downgrading network protocols and using SSL/TLS certificates. This position allows adversaries to collect network communications, including passed credentials, especially those sent over insecure, unencrypted protocols.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
