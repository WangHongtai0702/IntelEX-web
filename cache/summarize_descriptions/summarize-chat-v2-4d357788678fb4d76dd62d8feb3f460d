{"result": "HOSTS are computers or devices within a network that communicate with web services and may already use popular services like code repositories, providing cover for adversaries. These entities are assigned to IP addresses that may be revealed through scans. Adversaries may discover hosts through logs, and these systems within a network may communicate with popular websites and social media, potentially being used for Command and Control (C2) activities.
