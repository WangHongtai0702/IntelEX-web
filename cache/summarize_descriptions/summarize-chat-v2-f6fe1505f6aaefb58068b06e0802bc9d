{"result": "REMOTE SYSTEMS are computers or devices that can be accessed over a network from a different location. These systems, which include servers, are often used to store or retrieve data. Adversaries may discover remote systems through logs and aim to control them during Lateral Movement. They target these systems to execute malicious code by tainting shared content. Essentially, remote systems are integral parts of a network that can be accessed from another location, making them critical points of interest for both legitimate users and adversaries.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
