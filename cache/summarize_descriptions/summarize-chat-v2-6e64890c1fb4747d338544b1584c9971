{"result": "Process Hollowing is a technique where an attacker creates a process in a suspended state with benign arguments, which are later modified to malicious ones. This method involves unmapping the memory of the legitimate process and replacing it with malicious code, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary code in the address space of the separate live process. Process Hollowing is similar to Thread Execution Hijacking but specifically targets creating a new process in a suspended state rather than hijacking an existing one. It is also akin to process doppelgänging, as both techniques involve replacing the memory of a legitimate process to execute malicious code. Often, Process Hollowing is used in conjunction with other process injection techniques to achieve its malicious objectives.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
