{"result": "\"PROCESS INJECTION\" is a technique used by adversaries to inject malicious code into benign or legitimate system processes. This method allows the execution of arbitrary code within the address space of a separate live process, providing access to memory, system and network resources, and potentially elevated privileges. It is similar to reflective code injection and the abuse of AppCert DLLs, where a malicious DLL or executable is loaded and run in the context of separate processes. \n\nProcess Injection can be used to evade detection and execute malicious payloads by modifying callback functions in the KernelCallbackTable or by injecting code into targeted applications with the desired TCC permissions. Techniques such as TLS callback injection and process hollowing are also associated with process injection. This method is often employed to achieve privilege escalation and execute malicious content, as highlighted in the Elastic report from July 2017.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
