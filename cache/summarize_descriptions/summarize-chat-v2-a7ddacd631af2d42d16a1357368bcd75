It can be accessed over the internet and is often targeted by adversaries for various malicious activities. Adversaries may backdoor web servers with web shells to establish persistent access to systems. Additionally, web servers can be used by adversaries to host tools and malware for Ingress Tool Transfer, facilitating the transfer of malicious tools into a network. Furthermore, compromised web servers can support watering hole operations, where adversaries infect websites to target specific users.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
