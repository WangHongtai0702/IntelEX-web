{"result": "USERS are individuals or organizations who interact with network devices through CLI to perform various functions and utilize software dependencies and development tools. They may have accounts within the Active Directory domain, with their information stored in the NTDS file. USERS can be oblivious individuals who unknowingly install the Janicab trojan or may be tricked into misidentifying file types or other attributes of manipulated artifacts. They may inadvertently execute malicious code by opening tainted shared content or trust a signed piece of code more than an unsigned one, even without knowing the certificate issuer or author. USERS also attempt to log into services, potentially having their credentials captured by adversaries, and may be targeted through internal spearphishing.
