{"result": "DEFENSE EVASION is a tactic used by adversaries to avoid detection and bypass security measures throughout their compromise. This phase in the adversary lifecycle involves various techniques to subvert mitigation controls and security tools. Adversaries may use browser extensions to modify browser permissions, components, privacy settings, and other security controls. Additionally, hijacking execution flow and using stolen code signing certificates are methods employed to evade defenses. Overall, DEFENSE EVASION encompasses a range of strategies aimed at avoiding detection and maintaining the adversary's presence within a compromised system.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
