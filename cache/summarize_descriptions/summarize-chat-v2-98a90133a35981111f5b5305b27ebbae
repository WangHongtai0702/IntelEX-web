{"result": "SSL/TLS (Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security) are cryptographic protocols designed to provide secure communication over a computer network. These protocols are commonly used by web service providers to secure data transmission. SSL/TLS includes mechanisms for the client and server to agree on an encryption algorithm to use for subsequent secure connections. Once a connection is established, SSL/TLS uses symmetric cryptography for data transmission but employs asymmetric cryptography to establish or transmit the encryption key. These protocols are essential for encrypted web traffic, ensuring that data exchanged between clients and servers remains confidential and secure.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
