{"result": "\"SEARCH OPEN TECHNICAL DATABASES\" is a reconnaissance technique used by adversaries to gather information from publicly accessible technical databases. This method involves searching open technical databases to find useful information that can be leveraged for further attacks. Adversaries may use this technique to collect data about network security appliances, network trusts, victim domains, and their properties. It can be performed after gathering information from active scans and is a common activity in cyber reconnaissance to gather technical information from publicly available data sets.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
