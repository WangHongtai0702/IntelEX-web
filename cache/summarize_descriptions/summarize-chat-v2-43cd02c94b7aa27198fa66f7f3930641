{"result": "Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) is a proprietary protocol developed by Microsoft that provides a user with a graphical interface to connect to another computer over a network connection. It is a feature in operating systems that allows a user to log into an interactive session with a system desktop graphical user interface on a remote system. RDP is used by Terminal Services to transmit a full, interactive, graphical user interface to clients. Additionally, it is a resource-sharing software that differs from VNC, which is screen-sharing software. RDP also supports authenticated connections to transfer files between systems.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
