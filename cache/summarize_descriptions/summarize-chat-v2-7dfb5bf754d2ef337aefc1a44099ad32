{"result": "WEB PROTOCOLS are protocols used for communication over the internet, which can be encrypted using SSL/TLS certificates. These protocols are employed by adversaries to encrypt command and control (C2) traffic, ensuring secure communication back to adversary-owned infrastructure. In conjunction with Asymmetric Cryptography, WEB PROTOCOLS provide a robust method for encrypting C2 traffic, making it difficult for defenders to intercept and decipher the malicious communications.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
