{"result": "Cobalt Strike is a commercial, full-featured software platform designed for adversary simulations and red team operations. It bills itself as “adversary simulation software designed to execute targeted attacks and emulate the post-exploitation actions of advanced threat actors.” This tool is used for penetration testing and has interactive post-exploit capabilities covering the full range of ATT&CK tactics, all executed within a single, integrated system. Additionally, Cobalt Strike includes features such as browser pivoting. While primarily intended for legitimate security testing, it has also been used by adversaries for malicious purposes. Notably, Cobalt Strike has been delivered using DarkTortilla and loaded by HUI Loader in observed malicious campaigns.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
