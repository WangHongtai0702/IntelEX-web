It is a critical phase in a cyber attack where adversaries aim to gain control over more privileged accounts, which can include Domain Admin or higher privileged account sessions. Privilege escalation can result from exploitation for credential access, depending on the targeted process or obtained credentials, and can be facilitated by specific tools and utilities, such as the 'at' utility or certain COM objects. This tactic is essential for adversaries to expand their control within a network and access additional roles, permissions, or higher-privileged accounts [Data: Entities (111); Relationships (720, 384, 2261, 2267, 2282, +more)].\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"summary\": \"Kernel vulnerabilities as a target\",\n            \"explanation\": \"The kernel, being the core part of an operating system, is responsible for managing system resources and facilitating communication between hardware and software.
