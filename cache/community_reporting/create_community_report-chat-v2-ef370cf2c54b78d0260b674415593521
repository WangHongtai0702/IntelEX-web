It allows developers to host and review code, manage projects, and build software together. GitHub provides Internet hosting for software development and version control using Git, and it can be accessed via an API. This platform supports multiple people working on projects simultaneously, facilitating collaboration and version control.\n\nGitHub is widely used for hosting and sharing code repositories, and it is a significant resource for the development community. It hosts a variety of tools and utilities, including ROADTools, MailSniper, Ruler, PowerSploit Ninjacopy, Turla Driver Loader, AADInternals, Creddump7, Empire, Koadic, LaZagne, Mythic, Pacu, Peirates, PoshC2, Pupy, QuasarRAT, Responder, Rubeus, UACMe, BloodHound, KeeThief, the Ultimate AppLocker Bypass List, and the source code for PcShare. Additionally, GitHub is the original developer of the Electron framework.\n\nThe platform is also a repository for research and documentation on various security and development topics. It includes information on phishing techniques, Office 365 user enumeration, potential abuses of the Windows Time service, and the use of rundll32.exe for defense evasion. GitHub is cited for information on tools like NBNSpoof, Responder, and Hashjacking, and it hosts proof-of-concept code for hijacking SIP and trust provider components.\n\nGitHub is a third-party site where users can store source code in repositories and interact with them through web applications or command-line utilities such as git. It supports automation through webhook endpoints, which can post data automatically when changes occur, such as pushing a repository update.\n\nHowever, GitHub is also noted for its potential misuse.
