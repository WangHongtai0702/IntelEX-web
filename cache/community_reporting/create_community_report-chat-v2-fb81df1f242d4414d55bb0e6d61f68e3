It encompasses individual computers, networked devices, servers, and the collection of hardware and software components managed using protocols like ARP and SNMP. In the context of Windows operating systems, SYSTEM is a high-privilege user account with full administrative privileges, allowing processes to execute with elevated permissions. This account is used by the operating system and services, and it is one of the three system-defined sources of events in Windows Event Logs.\n\nAdversaries may target SYSTEM to wipe or corrupt data, escalate privileges, and bypass access controls. They may exploit software vulnerabilities to gain higher levels of access and interact with the system through command and control stages. SYSTEM also refers to the environment where tools like Mimikatz and Reg operate, and it is the context under which services and replaced binaries may execute with elevated permissions.\n\nIn summary, SYSTEM is a critical component in both individual computing devices and networked environments, representing a high-level permissions context that adversaries aim to exploit for malicious purposes.\",31\n18,NETWORK,\"A network is a collection of interconnected computers and devices that communicate with each other, facilitating communication and resource-sharing among a wide range of users. It is managed using protocols such as Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) and often contains shared network drives and folders. Networks can be accessed through various means, including web servers backdoored with web shells, and they provide cover for adversaries' Command and Control (C2) activities by communicating with popular websites and social media.\n\nAdversaries may target networks to propagate malware, escalate privileges, interrupt availability, and steal data. Networks are also the medium over which Virtual Network Computing (VNC) relays screen, mouse, and keyboard inputs.
