It is the current operating system for Mac computers, succeeding OSX. macOS includes a variety of built-in utilities and features, such as kernel extensions (kexts) to extend kernel functionality, Unix shells as its primary command prompt, and the default shell for macOS 10.15+ is zsh. It supports email rules for managing incoming emails and includes JavaScript for Automation (JXA).\n\nmacOS provides several frameworks like Cocoa and Foundation, and uses XPC services for inter-process communication. It includes built-in command functions like `rm` and `unlink` for file deletion, and utilities like `systemsetup` for managing system settings. The operating system also supports code signing to verify software on first run and includes security features like System Integrity Protection (SIP) and Transparency, Consent, and Control (TCC).\n\nmacOS tracks command history in a file pointed to by the environment variable HISTFILE and stores information highlighting connection history in system logs. It uses plist files for application properties and configuration settings, and the `sharing -l` command to list all shared points used for SMB services. The operating system also includes the AuthorizationExecuteWithPrivileges API and supports the use of the `at` utility for task scheduling.\n\nUsers can mark specific files as hidden by putting a “.” as the first character in the file or folder name, or by using the UF_HIDDEN flag. macOS includes preinstalled utilities like bzip2 and the tar utility, and often comes with SSH installed by default. It supports remote desktop control via VNC software and uses Samba to implement SMB for network file sharing. The operating system stores Kerberos tickets in a standard ccache format, similar to Linux, and allows setting and discovering password policies via command shell utilities.\n\nmacOS is targeted by various adversaries and malware, including ThiefQuest, Proton backdoor, and Green Lambert. It is vulnerable to techniques like dylib hijacking and can be targeted by uncompiled code payloads. Adversaries can use the DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES environment variable to load malicious libraries, and previous to macOS 11, they could silently install browser extensions via the command line using the `profiles` tool.
