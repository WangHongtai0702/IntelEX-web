This phase in a cyber attack involves various techniques to ensure continued access to compromised systems across restarts, changed credentials, and other interruptions that could cut off their access. Adversaries may use discovered cloud resources, modify configuration files or binaries, hijack execution flow, or utilize specific COM objects to achieve persistence. Techniques can include the use of cron jobs to schedule malicious code execution, the 'at' utility to execute programs at system startup or on a scheduled basis, and the modification of plist files.
