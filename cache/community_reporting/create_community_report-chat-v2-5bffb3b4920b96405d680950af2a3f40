This technique is closely associated with malvertising, where malicious ads are used to deliver exploit code to victims. Key entities in this community include JavaScript, which is often used in these attacks, and various organizations and reports that provide information on these techniques.\n\n## Drive-by Compromise as a central technique\n\nDrive-by Compromise is a cyber attack technique where adversaries exploit vulnerabilities in a user's web browser, software, or plugins to gain initial access to a system. This method involves compromising a user's device simply by visiting a malicious website, often without any further interaction required from the user. Adversaries may compromise web servers to deliver malicious content to visitors, stage web resources necessary to conduct attacks, and manipulate SEO rankings to promote these malicious sites. The technique can involve delivering payloads that include obfuscated commands and can be used to avoid setting the quarantine flag on downloaded files. Drive-by Compromise often leverages malvertising, where minimal interaction from the victim is needed, and can infect systems through normal web browsing activities. The malicious scripts hosted on these websites execute behaviors when visited by users, making it a stealthy and effective method for adversaries to deliver malware to unsuspecting users [Data: Entities (818); Relationships (872, 6133, 6197, 6204, 6205, +more)].\n\n## Role of Malvertising in Drive-by Compromise\n\nMalvertising is a technique where adversaries craft malicious web advertisements and purchase ad space on websites. These malicious ads are paid for and served through legitimate ad providers, making it difficult for users to distinguish between safe and harmful content. Malvertising is often used to support Drive-by Compromise by delivering exploit code to a victim's system with minimal interaction. This technique can involve compromised websites, where malicious payloads are hosted, and manipulated SEO rankings to increase their visibility. The primary goal of a Drive-by Target attack is to exploit vulnerabilities in a browser or its plugins, thereby compromising the victim's system [Data: Entities (2610); Relationships (6196, 7998, 8784, 8794, 8782, +more)].\n\n## JavaScript's involvement in Drive-by Compromise\n\nJavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled, platform-independent scripting language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification. It is commonly used in web development to decide what content to serve to the user on an HTML page. However, it can also be executed in runtime environments outside the browser. In addition to its legitimate uses, JavaScript can be exploited for malicious purposes. Adversaries may use it to inject malicious content into websites or generate DDoS code in web censorship attacks. Specifically, JavaScript can be utilized to inject malicious content as part of a Drive-by Compromise. This makes JavaScript a critical component in the execution of these attacks [Data: Entities (881); Relationships (6206, 6370, 6373, 6374, 6375, +more)].\n\n## SEO manipulation in facilitating Drive-by Compromise\n\nSearch Engine Optimization (SEO) techniques are manipulated by adversaries to facilitate Drive-by Compromise. By promoting malicious websites through manipulated SEO rankings, adversaries increase the visibility of these sites, making it more likely that users will visit them. This manipulation can involve various strategies, such as keyword stuffing, link farming, and creating fake reviews. Organizations like MalwareBytes, Sophos, and ZScaler provide information on how adversaries manipulate SEO rankings to facilitate Drive-by Compromise. This manipulation is a critical step in the execution of these attacks, as it helps drive traffic to the malicious sites [Data: Entities (3920, 3919, 3922); Relationships (6199, 6202, 6200, 6201, 6203, +more)].\n\n## Information sources on Drive-by Compromise and Malvertising\n\nVarious organizations and reports provide valuable information on Drive-by Compromise and malvertising techniques. For instance, MalwareBytes, Sophos, and ZScaler offer insights into how adversaries manipulate SEO rankings to promote malicious sites. The DFIR Report and Atlas SEO are also cited for information on SEO poisoning techniques used by adversaries. Additionally, the BBC and Guardio provide information on malvertising, including masquerading ads that trick victims into clicking on malicious domains.
