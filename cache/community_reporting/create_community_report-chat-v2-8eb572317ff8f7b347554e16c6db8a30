This technique forces the target process to load a dynamic link library, thereby allowing the injected code to run within the address space of the other process.

CreateRemoteThread is used to create a new thread in a remote process, often to invoke DLL injection. LoadLibrary is responsible for loading DLLs into the address space of a process. VirtualAllocEx is used to allocate memory in the address space of a specified process, and WriteProcessMemory is used to write data to the memory of a specified process. These functions are essential for the execution of DLL injection techniques [Data: Entities (1091, 1092, 1093, 1094); Relationships (6905, 6906, 6907, 6908)].\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"summary\": \"Variations of DLL Injection\",\n            \"explanation\": \"There are several variations of DLL injection, each with its unique characteristics. Reflective DLL Injection involves writing a self-mapping DLL into a process to overcome address relocation issues. Memory Module is another variation where the DLL is mapped into the process memory, allowing execution without using additional APIs. Module Stomping is used to conceal injected code by overwriting the memory of a legitimate module. These variations demonstrate the adaptability and complexity of DLL injection techniques [Data: Entities (1089, 1090); Relationships (6903, 6904, 6899)].\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"summary\": \"Thread Execution Hijacking\",\n            \"explanation\": \"Thread Execution Hijacking is a technique that can involve replacing the memory of a process with the path to a DLL, effectively hijacking the execution of a thread.
