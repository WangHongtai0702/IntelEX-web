Users may browse websites and encounter security warnings if the website's certificate is not trusted. They define automated behaviors to manage email messages in Microsoft Outlook and interact with the Bash shell, where their command history is stored in the .bash_history file. Users also utilize the OS X operating system, with their credentials stored in the keychain, and interact with macOS systems, granting permissions through TCC.\n\nUsers are responsible for enabling SSH and configuring authentication on servers, and they often provide credentials to various locations during normal system usage, such as login pages or system dialog boxes. They utilize multi-factor authentication mechanisms to secure access to systems and services.\n\nHowever, users are also potential targets for adversaries. Their tokens can be duplicated or impersonated, and their credentials may be leveraged by adversaries to access systems. Users may be deceived by adversaries mimicking valid code signatures or tricked into opening files with double extensions, inadvertently executing hidden malware. They may introduce USB devices or other physical media into a network, potentially facilitating data exfiltration.\n\nWithin an enterprise network, users may be affected by defacement activities and targeted for social engineering attacks.
