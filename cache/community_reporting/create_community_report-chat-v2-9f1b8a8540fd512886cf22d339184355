Key entities include techniques such as lateral movement, account discovery, and privilege escalation, all of which are interconnected with the use of valid accounts. The relationships between these entities highlight the various methods adversaries use to compromise and maintain access to systems.\n\n## Role of Valid Accounts in Unauthorized Access\n\nValid accounts are a crucial technique used by adversaries to gain unauthorized access to systems and networks. These accounts, which are legitimate user accounts that have been compromised, allow adversaries to authenticate to services or systems, gain access to additional resources, and maintain persistent access within a compromised environment. The use of valid accounts is often facilitated by techniques such as credential pharming, compromising the enterprise network, or harvesting reusable credentials from compromised network devices [Data: Entities (729); Relationships (745, 325, 1164, 1489, 3109, +more)].\n\n## Lateral Movement Enabled by Valid Accounts\n\nLateral movement is a technique used by adversaries to enter and control remote systems on a network. This phase involves moving through a network to gain access to additional systems, data, and resources. Compromised valid accounts play a significant role in facilitating lateral movement, allowing attackers to pivot through multiple systems and accounts. This technique is critical for adversaries to expand their control and gather valuable information within a compromised network [Data: Entities (352); Relationships (626, 4104, 2601, 1428, 2051, +more)].\n\n## Account Discovery and Valid Accounts\n\nAccount discovery is a technique where adversaries gather information about user accounts. This information can be used to identify valid accounts that can be compromised to gain unauthorized access to systems. Adversaries may use various methods to perform account discovery, including brute force attacks and leveraging knowledge gathered from other compromised accounts. The relationship between account discovery and valid accounts is crucial in understanding how adversaries identify and exploit user accounts [Data: Entities (345); Relationships (527, 4051)].\n\n## Privilege Escalation Through Valid Accounts\n\nPrivilege escalation is a technique used by adversaries to gain higher-level access within a compromised system. This can be achieved through the use of compromised valid accounts, where adversaries exploit cracked hashes from these accounts to gain unauthorized access. Higher-privileged accounts are particularly valuable for adversaries as they provide greater control and potential impact within the targeted system. The relationship between privilege escalation and valid accounts highlights the importance of protecting high-privilege accounts to prevent significant security breaches [Data: Entities (729); Relationships (2261, 2282)].\n\n## Use of External Remote Services with Valid Accounts\n\nAdversaries may use valid accounts in conjunction with external remote services to gain initial access to a network. This strategy often involves combining brute forcing activity with external remote services, such as VPNs, to infiltrate a network. The use of valid accounts in this context highlights the importance of securing remote access services to prevent unauthorized access and potential security breaches [Data: Entities (1907); Relationships (5890, 5906, 6026)].\n\n## Impact of Compromised Valid Accounts on Cloud Services\n\nCompromised valid accounts can be used by adversaries to access various cloud services, including AWS EC2 Instance Connect, Azure Serial Console, and other cloud-based platforms. This access allows adversaries to interact with remote systems and services, potentially leading to significant security breaches. The relationship between valid accounts and cloud services underscores the need for robust security measures to protect cloud environments from unauthorized access [Data: Entities (729); Relationships (5912, 5917, 5918, 5919)].\n\n## Media Reports on the Use of Valid Accounts\n\nVarious media reports have highlighted the use of valid accounts in significant security breaches. For example, the Sony 2018 attack and the Uber breach involved the use of valid accounts to propagate malware and gain access to additional resources. These reports emphasize the critical role valid accounts play in enabling adversaries to conduct large-scale cyber attacks and the importance of securing user credentials to prevent such incidents [Data: Relationships (5896, 5898, 5899)].\n\n## Techniques for Maintaining Access Using Valid Accounts\n\nAdversaries employ various techniques to maintain access to compromised systems using valid accounts. These techniques include input capture, remote service session hijacking, and the use of multi-factor authentication (MFA) services. By leveraging valid accounts, adversaries can ensure persistent access to systems, making it challenging to detect and expel them from the network. Understanding these techniques is essential for developing effective security measures to protect against persistent threats [Data: Entities (729); Relationships (5886, 5916, 5924)].\"\n755,\"# Privilege Escalation and Adversary Tactics\n\nThe community revolves around the tactic of Privilege Escalation, which is a critical phase in cyber attacks where adversaries aim to gain higher-level permissions within a system or network. Key entities include various elevated access accounts, operating system features, and cybersecurity firms reporting on these activities. The relationships highlight how adversaries exploit vulnerabilities and use compromised credentials to achieve privilege escalation, impacting system security and control.\n\n## Privilege Escalation as a central tactic\n\nPrivilege Escalation is a tactic used by adversaries to gain higher-level permissions on a system or network. This process involves various techniques and methods, such as exploiting vulnerabilities, using compromised credentials, or manipulating accounts to achieve elevated access to resources that are normally protected from an application or user. It is a critical phase in a cyber attack where adversaries aim to gain control over more privileged accounts, which can include Domain Admin or higher privileged account sessions. Privilege escalation can result from exploitation for credential access, depending on the targeted process or obtained credentials, and can be facilitated by specific tools and utilities, such as the 'at' utility or certain COM objects. This tactic is essential for adversaries to expand their control within a network and access additional roles, permissions, or higher-privileged accounts [Data: Entities (111); Relationships (720, 384, 2261, 2267, 2282, +more)].\n\n## Kernel vulnerabilities as a target\n\nThe kernel, being the core part of an operating system, is responsible for managing system resources and facilitating communication between hardware and software. However, it can also have vulnerabilities that adversaries may exploit for privilege escalation, making it a potential target for malicious activities. Adversaries exploit these vulnerabilities to execute adversary-controlled code, thereby gaining unauthorized access to higher-level permissions within a system. This makes the kernel a critical component in the context of privilege escalation [Data: Entities (419); Relationships (556, 2258, 4591)].\n\n## Root and administrative accounts as high-value targets\n\nRoot and administrative accounts, such as the ROOT user account in Unix and Unix-like operating systems, have full administrative privileges. Adversaries often target these accounts for privilege escalation to gain the highest level of access within a system. By obtaining root permissions, adversaries can perform actions that would otherwise be restricted, allowing them to take full control of the system, access sensitive data, and execute malicious activities with elevated rights. This makes root and administrative accounts high-value targets in cyber attacks [Data: Entities (693, 4576, 3425, 3424, 3426); Relationships (152, 3624, 2271, 2263, 2262)].\n\n## Role of cybersecurity firms in reporting\n\nCybersecurity firms, such as Invictus IR, play a crucial role in reporting on adversary activities, including those involving privilege escalation. Reports like DangerDev 2024 provide detailed insights into how adversaries operate in cloud environments and the techniques they use to escalate privileges. These reports are essential for understanding the evolving threat landscape and developing strategies to mitigate the risks associated with privilege escalation [Data: Entities (5312, 5316); Relationships (2280, 10622)].\n\n## Exploitation of cloud services for privilege escalation\n\nAdversaries can exploit cloud services, such as AWS and Google Cloud, to perform privilege escalation. By manipulating IAM policies or using specific APIs like CreatePolicyVersion and AttachUserPolicy, adversaries can gain elevated permissions within cloud environments. This highlights the importance of securing cloud infrastructure and monitoring for suspicious activities that could indicate privilege escalation attempts [Data: Relationships (2278, 2279, 2283, 2284)].\n\n## Impact of compromised credentials\n\nCompromised credentials are a common method used by adversaries to achieve privilege escalation. By obtaining and abusing valid accounts, adversaries can gain unauthorized access to higher-level permissions within a system. This can include using cracked Kerberos tickets, exploiting misconfigured certificates, or hijacking RDP sessions to steal Domain Admin sessions. The use of compromised credentials underscores the need for robust authentication mechanisms and regular monitoring of account activities [Data: Relationships (2261, 2251, 2253, 2270, 2255)].\n\n## Persistence and lateral movement facilitated by privilege escalation\n\nPrivilege escalation is closely related to other stages in the adversary's lifecycle, such as persistence and lateral movement. By gaining elevated permissions, adversaries can establish persistence within a network, making it difficult to detect and remove them. Additionally, privilege escalation enables adversaries to move laterally within a network, accessing additional systems and expanding their control. This interconnectedness highlights the importance of addressing privilege escalation to prevent further adversary activities [Data: Relationships (2240, 2282)].\n\n## Use of specific tools and utilities\n\nAdversaries use specific tools and utilities to facilitate privilege escalation. For example, the 'at' utility can be used to gain elevated permissions, and certain COM objects can be exploited to achieve privilege escalation. Understanding the tools and techniques used by adversaries is essential for developing effective defenses and mitigating the risks associated with privilege escalation [Data: Relationships (2260, 2252)].\n\n## Role of operating system features\n\nOperating system features can play a significant role in privilege escalation. Features that allow an adversary to persist and execute in an elevated context can be exploited to gain higher-level permissions. This includes vulnerabilities in Windows Server's global symbolic links and the use of OS features to maintain elevated access. Securing operating system features and regularly updating systems to patch vulnerabilities are critical steps in preventing privilege escalation [Data: Entities (3428); Relationships (2266, 2287)].\n\n## Impact of privilege escalation on system security\n\nPrivilege escalation has a significant impact on system security. By gaining higher-level permissions, adversaries can perform actions that would otherwise be restricted, such as accessing sensitive data, executing malicious activities, and taking full control of the system. This makes privilege escalation a critical threat that needs to be addressed through robust security measures, regular monitoring, and timely response to detected activities [Data: Relationships (2256, 2268, 2288)].\"\n\n\n-----Entities-----\nhuman_readable_id,title,description,degree\n110,PERSISTENCE,\"PERSISTENCE is a tactic used by adversaries in cybersecurity to maintain their foothold on a system, network, or cloud environment. This phase in a cyber attack involves various techniques to ensure continued access to compromised systems across restarts, changed credentials, and other interruptions that could cut off their access. Adversaries may use discovered cloud resources, modify configuration files or binaries, hijack execution flow, or utilize specific COM objects to achieve persistence. Techniques can include the use of cron jobs to schedule malicious code execution, the 'at' utility to execute programs at system startup or on a scheduled basis, and the modification of plist files. Persistence can also involve the use of cloned root certificates to maintain access over an extended period. The primary goal of persistence is to ensure that adversaries can maintain their foothold on systems, often by employing methods that allow them to survive system reboots and other potential disruptions.\",41\n164,CREDENTIALS,\"CREDENTIALS are authentication data used to verify the identity of users or systems.
