Understanding these registry keys and their implications is essential for securing Windows systems [Data: Entities (2510, 2511, 2512, 2513); Relationships (8669, 8667, 8668, 8666)].\"\n287,\"# Token Impersonation and Theft Techniques\n\nThe community revolves around various techniques and functions related to token impersonation and theft, which are used by adversaries to escalate privileges and bypass access controls. Key entities include Token Impersonation/Theft, Make and Impersonate Token, and various API functions such as CreateProcessWithTokenW and DuplicateToken. These entities are interconnected through their use in unauthorized access and privilege escalation strategies.\n\n## Token Impersonation/Theft as a central technique\n\nToken Impersonation/Theft is a central technique in this community, where adversaries duplicate or steal an existing user token to impersonate another user. This method is used to escalate privileges and bypass access controls, allowing unauthorized access and actions under the guise of the impersonated user. The technique is integral to various other methods and functions, making it a critical component of the community [Data: Entities (1384); Relationships (635, 7407, 7403, 7409, 7408, 7411, 7410, 7406, +more)].\n\n## Make and Impersonate Token technique\n\nThe Make and Impersonate Token technique involves creating a new token to impersonate another user, distinct from Token Impersonation/Theft, which duplicates an existing token. This method is used by adversaries to gain unauthorized access and perform actions under the guise of the impersonated user. The technique is often used in conjunction with other methods, such as CreateProcessWithTokenW, to create new processes with the impersonated token [Data: Entities (1385); Relationships (636, 7406, 7404)].\n\n## Role of CreateProcessWithTokenW\n\nCreateProcessWithTokenW is an API function that allows the creation of a new process with the token and security context of another user. This function is used in the Token Impersonation/Theft technique to create new processes using a duplicated token, facilitating unauthorized actions under the guise of a legitimate user. The function is also associated with the loading of AppCert DLLs into processes, further enhancing its utility in privilege escalation strategies [Data: Entities (1382); Relationships (7403, 7405, 7404)].\n\n## DuplicateToken function\n\nDuplicateToken is a function that allows an adversary to duplicate an existing token to escalate privileges and bypass access controls. This function is a key component of the Token Impersonation/Theft technique, enabling attackers to perform unauthorized actions with the credentials of another user. The function can be used in conjunction with other methods, such as SetThreadToken and ImpersonateLoggedOnUser, to assign the impersonated token to a thread or impersonate a logged-on user's security context [Data: Entities (5922); Relationships (7409, 10801, 10874)].\n\n## LogonUser function\n\nThe LogonUser function is used to create a logon session for a user, returning a copy of the new session's access token. This function is distinct from Token Impersonation/Theft, as it creates a new user token instead of stealing or duplicating an existing one. The function can be used in conjunction with SetThreadToken to assign the token to a thread, further enhancing its utility in privilege escalation strategies [Data: Entities (5746); Relationships (7408, 10799, 10800)].\"\n\n\n-----Entities-----\nhuman_readable_id,title,description,degree\n2917,VIRTUAL NETWORK COMPUTING,\"Virtual Network Computing (VNC) is a platform-independent desktop sharing system that uses the RFB protocol to enable users to remotely control another computer’s display by relaying the screen, mouse, and keyboard inputs over the network\",15\n2140,WEB APPLICATIONS,Web applications are software applications that run on web servers and can be accessed through a web browser.
