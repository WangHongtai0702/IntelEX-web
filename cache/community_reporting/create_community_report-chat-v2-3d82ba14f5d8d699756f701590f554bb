These credentials, often referred to as valid accounts, are legitimate user accounts that have been compromised by adversaries. The technique involves using these valid accounts to gain initial access to systems, maintain access to compromised systems, and propagate malware, including ransomware, across a network.\n\nAdversaries may obtain valid accounts through various means such as credential pharming, compromising the enterprise network, or harvesting reusable credentials from compromised network devices. These accounts can be used to interact with remote network shares using SMB, log into remote machines, and access certain areas of the Windows Registry and remote systems.\n\nValid accounts are crucial for adversaries to authenticate to services or systems, gain unauthorized access to additional resources, and maintain persistent access within a compromised environment. Higher-privileged accounts, which adversaries may gain access to through privilege escalation, are particularly valuable for these purposes.\",53\n352,LATERAL MOVEMENT,\"Lateral Movement consists of techniques that adversaries use to enter and control remote systems on a network. This phase involves moving through a network to gain access to additional systems, data, and resources. Adversaries often use compromised credentials to pivot through multiple systems and accounts, aiming to find key data and assets. After gaining initial access, attackers employ various methods to move deeper into the network, sometimes using specific utilities like the 'at' utility to run processes under the context of specified accounts. This tactic is also utilized by certain malware, such as the Samurai backdoor, to facilitate movement within a network.
