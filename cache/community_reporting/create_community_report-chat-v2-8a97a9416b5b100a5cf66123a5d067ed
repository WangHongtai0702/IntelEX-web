This phase involves moving through a network to gain access to additional systems, data, and resources. Adversaries often use compromised credentials to pivot through multiple systems and accounts, aiming to find key data and assets. After gaining initial access, attackers employ various methods to move deeper into the network, sometimes using specific utilities like the 'at' utility to run processes under the context of specified accounts.
