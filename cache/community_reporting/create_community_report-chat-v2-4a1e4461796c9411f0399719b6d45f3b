This change is aimed at improving security and stability, as kernel extensions operate with high privileges and can potentially compromise the system.

This transition has significant implications for both developers and end-users. Developers must update their applications to use System Extensions, which can involve substantial code changes and testing. For end-users, this change can affect the compatibility of existing software, potentially leading to disruptions if applications are not updated in time.

They need to refactor their code to use System Extensions, which may require a deep understanding of the new APIs and frameworks provided by Apple. Additionally, developers must ensure that their applications maintain compatibility across different macOS versions, which can be a complex and time-consuming process. The transition also necessitates thorough testing to ensure that the new System Extensions do not introduce bugs or performance issues.

Kernel extensions operate with high privileges, and any bugs or vulnerabilities in these extensions can have severe consequences, including system crashes and security breaches. By moving to System Extensions, which run in user space, Apple aims to mitigate these risks. System Extensions have more restricted access to system resources, reducing the potential for critical failures and improving overall system stability. This shift reflects Apple's ongoing efforts to prioritize security and reliability in its operating systems [Data: Relationships (2059)].\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"summary\": \"User adaptation and potential disruptions\",\n            \"explanation\": \"The transition from kernel extensions to System Extensions can lead to potential disruptions for end-users, particularly if developers do not update their applications in a timely manner. Users may encounter compatibility issues with software that relies on deprecated kernel extensions, leading to reduced functionality or the need to find alternative applications.

However, the long-term benefits of improved security and stability are expected to outweigh the short-term inconveniences.
