Key entities include adversaries, contractors, and data, with significant relationships highlighting the adversaries' tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) to compromise systems, evade defenses, and maintain persistence.\n\n## Adversaries' use of digital certificates\n\nAdversaries install digital certificates on infrastructure under their control to exploit or manipulate systems for malicious purposes. This technique allows them to establish secure communication channels, evade detection, and maintain persistence within compromised environments. The installation of digital certificates is a critical step in the adversary lifecycle, enabling further malicious activities [Data: Entities (2038); Relationships (857, 340, 7981, 8122)].\n\n## Role of contractors in adversary operations\n\nContractors are external entities hired by adversaries to develop malware or provide specialized skills required for malware development. These individuals or organizations play a crucial role in enhancing the technical capabilities of adversaries, enabling them to execute sophisticated cyber operations. The relationship between adversaries and contractors underscores the collaborative nature of cyber threats [Data: Entities (776); Relationships (909, 305, 4743)].\n\n## Adversaries' data collection and exploitation\n\nAdversaries target data within systems for manipulation, interruption, or destruction. They use techniques such as VNC to monitor and control systems, collecting valuable information for planning future operations. The exploitation of data is a key objective for adversaries, as it provides them with the necessary intelligence to further their malicious activities [Data: Entities (2927); Relationships (753, 297, 392, 7515)].\n\n## Adversaries' defense evasion techniques\n\nAdversaries employ various techniques to evade detection and maintain their presence within compromised systems. These techniques include exploiting logic errors, downgrading operating systems, and using self-signed SSL/TLS certificates. Defense evasion is a critical phase in the adversary lifecycle, allowing them to bypass security measures and continue their operations undetected [Data: Entities (779); Relationships (366, 309, 370, 6054)].\n\n## Adversaries' command and control strategies\n\nAdversaries use command and control (C2) techniques to manage and control compromised systems.

By leveraging valid user credentials, they can evade detection and blend in with normal network traffic. This tactic highlights the importance of securing and monitoring credential usage within organizations [Data: Entities (5456); Relationships (325, 437, 318, 432)].\n\n## Adversaries' persistence mechanisms\n\nAdversaries use various persistence mechanisms to maintain their foothold on compromised systems. These mechanisms include installing root certificates, modifying startup items, and registering malicious transport agents.

Effective reconnaissance is essential for adversaries to plan and execute their operations successfully [Data: Entities (14); Relationships (389, 429, 430, 428)].\n\n## Adversaries' use of self-signed certificates\n\nAdversaries create and install self-signed SSL/TLS certificates to encrypt command and control traffic and enable Adversary-in-the-Middle attacks.
