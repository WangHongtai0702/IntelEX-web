Linux supports a variety of hardware platforms and includes built-in command-line interface and scripting capabilities.\n\nThe operating system provides a standard set of permission groups and permissions for managing file and directory ACLs, and it supports several different IPC mechanisms, including sockets and pipes. Linux also includes system calls like `time()` for collecting the current time and commands like `rm` and `unlink` for file deletion. It keeps track of system or user-initiated actions via system logs and stores connection history in these logs as well.\n\nLinux is often used in server environments and comes with preinstalled utilities like `bzip2`, `tar`, and the `mail` command line utility. It supports XDG-compliant systems and uses Unix shells as its primary command prompt. The operating system also supports the use of systemd timers and services for task scheduling and persistence, and it can execute programs at system startup or on a scheduled basis using cron.\n\nAdversaries may target Linux systems using various methods, including the LightNeuron backdoor, HiddenWasp, and Exaramel for Linux. They may execute a series of Native API calls to alter malware's process tree, use the `passwd` utility to change passwords, or abuse trusted binaries to proxy execution of malicious commands. Linux systems can be affected by rootkits and targeted by uncompiled code payloads. The operating system allows setting and discovering password policies via command shell utilities and supports the ptrace system call used for debugging and process control.\n\nLinux does not use code signing due to its decentralized nature, and it supports the use of Samba to implement SMB for network file sharing. The operating system includes built-in command functions and supports the use of the `at` utility for task scheduling by the superuser or users listed in the `at.allow` file. Wi-Fi network names and passwords may be stored in files under `/etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/`.\n\nLinux is supported by various tools for remote administration and post-exploitation, such as Pupy, and it can be targeted by adversaries using systemdsleep to prevent shutdown or hibernation.
