A potential victim may be someone targeted using compromised accounts. Victims can have their network traffic spoofed and poisoned, and their networks disrupted by denial of service attacks. Adversaries may gather information from social media to target individuals, and victims may have their emails forwarded without their knowledge. \n\nVictims' websites, network topology, trust dependencies, and overall networks are often targeted for information gathering. Adversaries may seek unauthorized access or launch attacks against victims, deceiving networked devices into believing they are communicating with intended devices. Information about victims' business relationships, resources, business tempo, hosts, IP addresses, physical locations, and system time and time zone settings may also be gathered by adversaries. In essence, a victim is the entity at the center of an adversary's malicious actions, facing a wide range of potential threats and information breaches.\",54\n1022,FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS,\"Financial Institutions are organizations that manage financial transactions and services, and they may be involved in the transfer of funds during adversarial activities.
