This method is significant as it allows adversaries to ensure persistence by assigning extra roles to cloud accounts, thereby extending their capabilities. This technique is particularly concerning as it can be abused in major cloud platforms like AWS and Google Cloud, where permissions such as IAM:PassRole and iam.serviceAccounts.actAs can be exploited [Data: Entities (3864); Relationships (4157, 5535)].\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"summary\": \"Additional Cloud Credentials for extended access\",\n            \"explanation\": \"The 'Additional Cloud Credentials' technique involves adversaries adding extra authentication details to cloud accounts to ensure persistence.
