Users also utilize the OS X operating system, with their credentials stored in the keychain, and interact with macOS systems, granting permissions through TCC.\n\nUsers are responsible for enabling SSH and configuring authentication on servers, and they often provide credentials to various locations during normal system usage, such as login pages or system dialog boxes. They utilize multi-factor authentication mechanisms to secure access to systems and services.\n\nHowever, users are also potential targets for adversaries. Their tokens can be duplicated or impersonated, and their credentials may be leveraged by adversaries to access systems.
