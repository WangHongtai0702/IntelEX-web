Google Hacking is supported by databases like ExploitDB and SecurityTrails, which provide information on these techniques [Data: Entities (2957); Relationships (1477, 4316, 5897, 4427, 4418, +more)].\n\n## Assessment Reports as a Source of Intelligence\n\nAssessment Reports are documents that evaluate the security posture, performance, condition, or compliance of an organization, system, or network. These reports provide detailed information about installed software and systems, revealing critical insights into the security and operational status of the evaluated entity. Adversaries may use the information contained within these reports to gather intelligence and potentially exploit vulnerabilities [Data: Entities (896); Relationships (4339, 6410)].\n\n## Network Maps for Network Layout Information\n\nNetwork Maps are diagrams that represent the structure and layout of a network, including the devices and their connections. These maps can be used by adversaries to gather information about the network. The exposure of network maps via phishing for information or open technical databases can provide adversaries with valuable insights into the network's structure and potential vulnerabilities [Data: Entities (895); Relationships (4338, 6409, 6442)].\n\n## Purchase Invoices Revealing System Acquisitions\n\nPurchase Invoices are documents that record the details of a transaction between a buyer and a seller. They detail the acquisition of goods or services, including software and hardware, and can potentially reveal information about an organization's systems and hardware infrastructure. Adversaries may use these invoices to gather valuable information about the target's environment [Data: Entities (898); Relationships (4341, 6411, 6445)].\n\n## Resumes as a Source of Technical Information\n\nResumes are documents that summarize an individual's professional experience, education, and skills. They typically list an individual's work experience and the software and systems they have worked with. Additionally, resumes may contain information about hardware infrastructure. Adversaries can use the detailed information in resumes to gather intelligence about a target organization [Data: Entities (897); Relationships (4340, 6444)].\n\n## Job Postings Providing Organizational Insights\n\nJob Postings are online advertisements for employment opportunities that are publicly accessible and reveal information about an organization's software, systems, and hardware infrastructure. These advertisements can inadvertently provide adversaries with valuable information, which they may use to gather insights about a target organization [Data: Entities (899); Relationships (4400, 6446)].\"\n\n\n-----Entities-----\nhuman_readable_id,title,description,degree\n283,VICTIMS,\"Victims are individuals or organizations targeted by adversaries for a variety of malicious activities. These activities include breaches, leveraged access, information gathering, impersonation, and social engineering techniques.
