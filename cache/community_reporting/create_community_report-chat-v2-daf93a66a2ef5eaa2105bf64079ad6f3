These utilities perform software packing by compressing or encrypting executables, making it more challenging for security systems to identify and analyze the malicious code.\",6\n515,SECURITY TOOLS,\"Security tools are software and systems designed to monitor, detect, and protect against malicious activities. These tools are used by analysts to generate detections based on data from sources such as Windows event logs. While they are effective in safeguarding systems, they may have limitations, such as being unable to detect activities within virtual instances. Additionally, security tools often trust signed pieces of code more than unsigned ones, even if the issuer of the certificate or the author is unknown. Adversaries frequently attempt to evade these tools through techniques like masquerading.\",5\n61,SOFTWARE PACKING,\"\"\"SOFTWARE PACKING\"\" is a method used to compress or encrypt an executable file to change its file signature and avoid signature-based detection. This technique is similar to dynamic API resolution, as it not only changes file signatures but also obfuscates malicious API function calls until they are resolved and invoked during runtime. By compressing and encrypting files, Software Packing effectively impedes detection, making it a common tactic for obfuscating files to evade security measures.\",4\n2452,SUBVERTING TRUST,\"\"\"Subverting Trust\"\" refers to the act of undermining trust mechanisms in digital signatures to bypass security policies. It involves the act of undermining security controls that identify trusted programs or websites.

It involves digitally signing executables and scripts to confirm the software author and ensure that the code has not been altered or corrupted. This process is a crucial security feature included in Gatekeeper, which verifies the authenticity of applications using a valid Apple Developer ID. However, it is important to note that the integrity of code signing can be compromised if cloned root certificates are used to bypass the verification process.\",16\n1217,DLL SEARCH ORDER HIJACKING,\"DLL Search Order Hijacking is a technique where adversaries exploit the order in which Windows searches for Dynamic Link Libraries (DLLs) to load malicious code. By manipulating the search order for loading DLLs, adversaries can ensure that their malicious code is executed by the operating system or a program. This technique takes advantage of the way the operating system prioritizes the loading of DLLs, allowing the adversaries to insert their malicious DLLs into the search path, thereby executing their code instead of the legitimate DLLs.\",4\n68,ENCRYPTING/ENCODING FILES,No Description,14\n4347,DUQU,\"Duqu is a sophisticated malware platform known for its modular approach, which allows it to extend its functionality after being deployed within a target network.

The group is also known for utilizing the RotaJakiro backdoor in its operations.\",7\n62,STEGANOGRAPHY,\"Steganography is a method and technique used to hide data within other non-secret or non-suspicious files or media to avoid detection. This process involves embedding the hidden data into legitimate digital media formats by weaving it into specific bytes and patterns, which can sometimes include malicious content. The primary goal of steganography is to conceal the existence of the hidden data, making it difficult for unauthorized parties to detect or access it.\",6\n1230,SPECTOROPS,\"SpectorOps is a cybersecurity firm renowned for its extensive research and insights into various aspects of cybersecurity.
