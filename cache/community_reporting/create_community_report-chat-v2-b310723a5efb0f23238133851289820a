These devices manage network traffic and perform crucial functions such as encryption to secure transmission. Common examples of network devices include routers, switches, and firewalls. However, network devices can also be targeted by adversaries using techniques like Patch System Image and Modify System Image. Adversaries may compromise these devices to create a multi-hop proxy chain by adding custom code to the affected devices, thereby leveraging them for malicious activities.\",19\n672,ENCRYPTION,\"Encryption is a security measure that protects data by converting it into a code to prevent unauthorized access. It is the process of converting plaintext into ciphertext to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of data communications. This technique is widely used to secure data and avoid detection during exfiltration, particularly in the context of malware. For instance, adversaries may use encryption to obfuscate hashes or identifiers in malware, making it harder for security systems to detect malicious activities. Additionally, encryption is employed by ransomware, such as Maze ransomware, to lock files on victim machines, thereby preventing access until a ransom is paid. Overall, encryption is a critical tool in safeguarding information and maintaining data security.\",17\n11,PATCH SYSTEM IMAGE,\"Patch System Image is a technique employed by adversaries to manipulate the operating system of network and embedded devices for various malicious purposes. This technique can be used in conjunction with downgrading the system image to evade defenses. Adversaries may change the operating system to implement their own custom Network Address Translation (NAT) mechanisms, which helps obscure their activities. Additionally, they can hard code a password into the operating system, thereby bypassing native authentication mechanisms for local accounts on network devices. Patch System Image also enables the modification of network devices to facilitate traffic redirection. Furthermore, adversaries may add custom code to routers to implement onion routing between nodes, enhancing their ability to conceal their network traffic.\",9\n1301,MODIFY SYSTEM IMAGE,\"\"\"Modify System Image\"\" is a technique used by adversaries to alter the system image of network devices. This technique can be employed to implant code into the operating system, providing access using a specific password. It also allows adversaries to introduce hooks into the operating system to read raw keystrokes during login sessions. Additionally, \"\"Modify System Image\"\" can be used to change the configuration of a network device, potentially compromising its encryption capabilities or even disabling dedicated hardware encryption.
