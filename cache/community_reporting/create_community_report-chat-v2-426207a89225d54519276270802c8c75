It provides a secure channel in a client-server architecture, allowing for secure remote login, remote management, and authentication of sessions. SSH is commonly used to securely access and manage network devices and servers, and it is a standard means of remote access on Linux and macOS systems. Users can connect to another system via an encrypted tunnel, typically authenticating through a password, certificate, or asymmetric encryption key pair.\n\nSSH creates hidden .ssh folders to store userâ€™s known hosts and keys, ensuring secure storage of authentication credentials. It is also used to securely access remote systems and can activate systemd timers remotely via the systemctl command line utility. Additionally, SSH is a commonly targeted management service over port 22/TCP for password guessing attacks.\n\nDespite its security features, adversaries may exploit SSH for internal connections within an enclave, and its binaries can be replaced by malicious software like Ebury.
