CISA is connected to various entities and cyber threats, including malware like Stuxnet, SUPERNOVA, and Cyclops Blink, as well as threat groups such as APT29 and APT40. The agency provides extensive guidance, advisories, and reports on these threats, highlighting its central role in the cybersecurity landscape.\n\n## CISA's central role in national cybersecurity\n\nCISA is a U.S. government agency responsible for enhancing the security, resilience, and reliability of the nation's cybersecurity and communications infrastructure. The agency provides crucial guidance, resources, and advisories to protect critical infrastructure from cyber threats. CISA's involvement in reporting and providing information on various cyber threats and vulnerabilities underscores its importance in the cybersecurity community [Data: Entities (622); Relationships (2915, 1206, 1501, 1618, 1537, +more)].\n\n## Significant malware threats reported by CISA\n\nCISA has reported on several significant malware threats, including Stuxnet, SUPERNOVA, and Cyclops Blink. Stuxnet is a malicious computer worm that targeted SCADA systems and was first uncovered in 2010 [Data: Entities (1220); Relationships (129, 3285, 5483, 7123, 7124, +more)]. SUPERNOVA is an in-memory web shell discovered during the investigation of APT29's SolarWinds cyber operation [Data: Entities (2040); Relationships (1621, 4487, 5467, 8137, 8136)]. Cyclops Blink is a modular malware targeting SOHO network devices [Data: Entities (4825); Relationships (2197, 5477, 8732, 7779, 10336, +more)].\n\n## CISA's reports on advanced persistent threat (APT) groups\n\nCISA has provided detailed information on various APT groups, including APT29 and APT40. APT29, also known as Cozy Bear, is a Russian state-sponsored group involved in cyber espionage [Data: Relationships (1618, 1621, 1627, 5270)]. APT40 is a Chinese state-sponsored group known for its cyber espionage activities [Data: Entities (1537); Relationships (5464)]. CISA's reports on these groups help in understanding their tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), which is crucial for defending against their attacks.\n\n## CISA's advisories on phishing and remote monitoring software\n\nCISA has reported on various phishing techniques, including the use of remote monitoring and management software.
