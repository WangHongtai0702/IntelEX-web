The use of custom malware suggests a high level of technical capability and a targeted approach to cyber attacks [Data: Entities (5236, 5238, 5237); Relationships (122, 123, 4513, 4514, 10580, 10581, 10582)].\n\n## Daserf backdoor targeting multiple countries\n\nDaserf is a backdoor used to spy on and steal from victims in Japan, South Korea, Russia, Singapore, and China. The widespread use of Daserf across multiple countries highlights its effectiveness and the significant threat it poses to cybersecurity. Reports from various cybersecurity firms further underscore the severity of this threat [Data: Entities (5824); Relationships (2212, 7241, 5198, 3028, 5951, 9968, 8598)].\n\n## GoldenSky malware targeting organizations in China\n\nGoldenSky is a backdoor malware discovered targeting organizations in China, packaged with legitimate tax preparation software. This malware's delivery method through legitimate software indicates a sophisticated approach to infiltrating target systems. The involvement of the Golden Tax Department and Aisino Credit Information Co. in producing the software further complicates the situation, raising concerns about potential insider threats or compromised supply chains [Data: Entities (2428, 2429, 2430, 2431); Relationships (7933, 8591, 8593, 8594)].\n\n## Use of Delphi programming language in malware development\n\nThe Delphi programming language has been utilized to write various backdoors, including some versions of the Daserf backdoor and the RTM malware. This indicates a preference for Delphi among certain cyber espionage groups, possibly due to its specific features or the familiarity of the developers with the language. The use of Delphi in multiple malware instances suggests a commonality in the technical approaches of these groups [Data: Entities (3202); Relationships (9324, 9325, 9326)].\"\n\n\n-----Entities-----\nhuman_readable_id,title,description,degree\n3757,AUTOIT BACKDOOR,AutoIt backdoor is malware used by actors responsible for the Monsoon campaign,3\n1482,XCSSET,\"XCSSET is a macOS modular backdoor that targets Xcode application developers.
