Credentials may be sent and stored in user chat communication applications such as email, chat services like Slack or Teams, collaboration tools like Jira or Trello, and any other services that support user communication. Users may share various forms of credentials (such as usernames and passwords, API keys, or authentication tokens) on private or public corporate internal communications channels.\n\nRather than accessing the stored chat logs (i.e., [Credentials In Files](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1552/001)), adversaries may directly access credentials within these services on the user endpoint, through servers hosting the services, or through administrator portals for cloud hosted services. Adversaries may also compromise integration tools like Slack Workflows to automatically search through messages to extract user credentials. These credentials may then be abused to perform follow-on activities such as lateral movement or privilege escalation (Citation: Slack Security Risks).\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>SLACK<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Slack is a chat service used for user communication where credentials may be shared and potentially compromised by adversaries)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TEAMS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Teams is a chat service used for user communication where credentials may be shared and potentially compromised by adversaries)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JIRA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Jira is a collaboration tool used for user communication where credentials may be shared and potentially compromised by adversaries)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TRELLO<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Trello is a collaboration tool used for user communication where credentials may be shared and potentially compromised by adversaries)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SLACK WORKFLOWS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Slack Workflows is an integration tool within Slack that can be compromised by adversaries to automatically search through messages to extract user credentials)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CREDENTIALS IN FILES<|>EVENT<|>Credentials In Files is a technique where adversaries access stored chat logs to obtain credentials)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SLACK<|>SLACK WORKFLOWS<|>Slack Workflows is an integration tool within Slack that can be compromised to extract user credentials<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SLACK<|>CREDENTIALS IN FILES<|>Slack is a service where adversaries may access stored chat logs to obtain credentials<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TEAMS<|>CREDENTIALS IN FILES<|>Teams is a service where adversaries may access stored chat logs to obtain credentials<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JIRA<|>CREDENTIALS IN FILES<|>Jira is a service where adversaries may access stored chat logs to obtain credentials<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TRELLO<|>CREDENTIALS IN FILES<|>Trello is a service where adversaries may access stored chat logs to obtain credentials<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
