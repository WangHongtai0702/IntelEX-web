The network configuration is a file containing parameters that determine the operation of the device. The device typically stores an in-memory copy of the configuration while operating, and a separate configuration on non-volatile storage to load after device reset. Adversaries can inspect the configuration files to reveal information about the target network and its layout, the network device and its software, or identifying legitimate accounts and credentials for later use.\n\nAdversaries can use common management tools and protocols, such as Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) and Smart Install (SMI), to access network configuration files.(Citation: US-CERT TA18-106A Network Infrastructure Devices 2018)(Citation: Cisco Blog Legacy Device Attacks) These tools may be used to query specific data from a configuration repository or configure the device to export the configuration for later analysis.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>US-CERT TA18-106A<|>EVENT<|>A report or advisory issued by US-CERT in 2018 regarding network infrastructure devices)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CISCO<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Cisco is a technology company that provides networking hardware, software, and telecommunications equipment)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SNMP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Simple Network Management Protocol is a protocol used for network management)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SMI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Smart Install is a protocol used for network management)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>US-CERT TA18-106A<|>CISCO<|>Cisco's blog is cited in the US-CERT TA18-106A advisory<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SNMP<|>CISCO<|>Cisco's blog discusses attacks on legacy devices using SNMP<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SMI<|>CISCO<|>Cisco's blog discusses attacks on legacy devices using SMI<|>4)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
