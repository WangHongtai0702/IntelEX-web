Exploitation of a software vulnerability occurs when an adversary takes advantage of a programming error in a program, service, or within the operating system software or kernel itself to execute adversary-controlled code.Â A common goal for post-compromise exploitation of remote services is for lateral movement to enable access to a remote system.\n\nAn adversary may need to determine if the remote system is in a vulnerable state, which may be done through [Network Service Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1046) or other Discovery methods looking for common, vulnerable software that may be deployed in the network, the lack of certain patches that may indicate vulnerabilities,  or security software that may be used to detect or contain remote exploitation. Servers are likely a high value target for lateral movement exploitation, but endpoint systems may also be at risk if they provide an advantage or access to additional resources.\n\nThere are several well-known vulnerabilities that exist in common services such as SMB (Citation: CIS Multiple SMB Vulnerabilities) and RDP (Citation: NVD CVE-2017-0176) as well as applications that may be used within internal networks such as MySQL (Citation: NVD CVE-2016-6662) and web server services.(Citation: NVD CVE-2014-7169)\n\nDepending on the permissions level of the vulnerable remote service an adversary may achieve [Exploitation for Privilege Escalation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1068) as a result of lateral movement exploitation as well.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>SMB<|>ORGANIZATION<|>SMB (Server Message Block) is a network file sharing protocol that allows applications to read and write to files and request services from server programs in a computer network)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RDP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) is a proprietary protocol developed by Microsoft, which provides a user with a graphical interface to connect to another computer over a network connection)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MYSQL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>MySQL is an open-source relational database management system based on SQL (Structured Query Language))\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NVD CVE-2017-0176<|>EVENT<|>A well-known vulnerability in RDP that can be exploited by adversaries to gain unauthorized access to systems)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NVD CVE-2016-6662<|>EVENT<|>A well-known vulnerability in MySQL that can be exploited by adversaries to gain unauthorized access to systems)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NVD CVE-2014-7169<|>EVENT<|>A well-known vulnerability in web server services that can be exploited by adversaries to gain unauthorized access to systems)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SMB<|>NVD CVE-2017-0176<|>SMB is mentioned alongside RDP as a common service with well-known vulnerabilities<|>3)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RDP<|>NVD CVE-2017-0176<|>NVD CVE-2017-0176 is a specific vulnerability in RDP<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MYSQL<|>NVD CVE-2016-6662<|>NVD CVE-2016-6662 is a specific vulnerability in MySQL<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WEB SERVER SERVICES<|>NVD CVE-2014-7169<|>NVD CVE-2014-7169 is a specific vulnerability in web server services<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
