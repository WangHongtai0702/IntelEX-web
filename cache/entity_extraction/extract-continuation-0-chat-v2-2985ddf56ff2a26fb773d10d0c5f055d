Ads can be purchased to plant as well as favorably position artifacts in specific locations  online, such as prominently placed within search engine results. These ads may make it more difficult for users to distinguish between actual search results and advertisements.(Citation: spamhaus-malvertising) Purchased ads may also target specific audiences using the advertising network’s capabilities, potentially further taking advantage of the trust inherently given to search engines and popular websites. \n\nAdversaries may purchase ads and other resources to help distribute artifacts containing malicious code to victims. Purchased ads may attempt to impersonate or spoof well-known brands. For example, these spoofed ads may trick victims into clicking the ad which could then send them to a malicious domain that may be a clone of official websites containing trojanized versions of the advertised software.(Citation: Masquerads-Guardio)(Citation: FBI-search) Adversary’s efforts to create malicious domains and purchase advertisements may also be automated at scale to better resist cleanup efforts.(Citation: sentinelone-malvertising) \n\nMalvertising may be used to support [Drive-by Target](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1608/004) and [Drive-by Compromise](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1189), potentially requiring limited interaction from the user if the ad contains code/exploits that infect the target system's web browser.(Citation: BBC-malvertising)\n\nAdversaries may also employ several techniques to evade detection by the advertising network. For example, adversaries may dynamically route ad clicks to send automated crawler/policy enforcer traffic to benign sites while validating potential targets then sending victims referred from real ad clicks to malicious pages. This infection vector may therefore remain hidden from the ad network as well as any visitor not reaching the malicious sites with a valid identifier from clicking on the advertisement.(Citation: Masquerads-Guardio) Other tricks, such as intentional typos to avoid brand reputation monitoring, may also be used to evade automated detection.(Citation: spamhaus-malvertising)\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>SPAMHAUS-MALVERTISING<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Spamhaus is an organization that provides information on malvertising, which involves the use of online advertisements to distribute malware to victims)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GUARDIO<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Guardio is an organization cited for providing information on masquerading ads that trick victims into clicking on malicious domains)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FBI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The FBI is a government agency cited for providing information on search engine malvertising)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SENTINELONE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>SentinelOne is an organization cited for providing information on automated efforts to create malicious domains and purchase advertisements)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BBC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The BBC is a media organization cited for providing information on malvertising supporting drive-by target and drive-by compromise techniques)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DRIVE-BY TARGET<|>EVENT<|>Drive-by Target is a technique where malicious code is delivered to a victim's system through minimal interaction, often via malvertising)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DRIVE-BY COMPROMISE<|>EVENT<|>Drive-by Compromise is a technique where a victim's system is compromised through minimal interaction, often via malvertising)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SPAMHAUS-MALVERTISING<|>MALVERTISING<|>Spamhaus provides information on malvertising, which involves the use of online advertisements to distribute malware<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GUARDIO<|>MALVERTISING<|>Guardio provides information on masquerading ads that trick victims into clicking on malicious domains<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FBI<|>MALVERTISING<|>The FBI provides information on search engine malvertising<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SENTINELONE<|>MALVERTISING<|>SentinelOne provides information on automated efforts to create malicious domains and purchase advertisements<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BBC<|>MALVERTISING<|>The BBC provides information on malvertising supporting drive-by target and drive-by compromise techniques<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DRIVE-BY TARGET<|>MALVERTISING<|>Drive-by Target is a technique supported by malvertising<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DRIVE-BY COMPROMISE<|>MALVERTISING<|>Drive-by Compromise is a technique supported by malvertising<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
