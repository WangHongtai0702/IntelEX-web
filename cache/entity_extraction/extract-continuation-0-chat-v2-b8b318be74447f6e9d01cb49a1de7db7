DLL injection is a method of executing arbitrary code in the address space of a separate live process.  \n\nDLL injection is commonly performed by writing the path to a DLL in the virtual address space of the target process before loading the DLL by invoking a new thread. The write can be performed with native Windows API calls such as <code>VirtualAllocEx</code> and <code>WriteProcessMemory</code>, then invoked with <code>CreateRemoteThread</code> (which calls the <code>LoadLibrary</code> API responsible for loading the DLL). (Citation: Elastic Process Injection July 2017) \n\nVariations of this method such as reflective DLL injection (writing a self-mapping DLL into a process) and memory module (map DLL when writing into process) overcome the address relocation issue as well as the additional APIs to invoke execution (since these methods load and execute the files in memory by manually preforming the function of <code>LoadLibrary</code>).(Citation: Elastic HuntingNMemory June 2017)(Citation: Elastic Process Injection July 2017) \n\nAnother variation of this method, often referred to as Module Stomping/Overloading or DLL Hollowing, may be leveraged to conceal injected code within a process. This method involves loading a legitimate DLL into a remote process then manually overwriting the module's <code>AddressOfEntryPoint</code> before starting a new thread in the target process.(Citation: Module Stomping for Shellcode Injection) This variation allows attackers to hide malicious injected code by potentially backing its execution with a legitimate DLL file on disk.(Citation: Hiding Malicious Code with Module Stomping) \n\nRunning code in the context of another process may allow access to the process's memory, system/network resources, and possibly elevated privileges. Execution via DLL injection may also evade detection from security products since the execution is masked under a legitimate process.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ELASTIC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Elastic is a company that provides insights and research on process injection techniques, including DLL injection and its variations)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WINDOWS API<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Windows API is a set of application programming interfaces provided by Microsoft for Windows operating systems, used for various system-level operations including memory allocation and process management)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MODULE STOMPING<|>EVENT<|>Module Stomping, also known as Module Overloading or DLL Hollowing, is a technique used to conceal injected code within a process by overwriting a legitimate DLL's entry point)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DLL INJECTION<|>EVENT<|>DLL Injection is a method of executing arbitrary code in the address space of a separate live process by injecting a dynamic-link library)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>REFLECTIVE DLL INJECTION<|>EVENT<|>Reflective DLL Injection is a variation of DLL injection that involves writing a self-mapping DLL into a process to overcome address relocation issues)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MEMORY MODULE<|>EVENT<|>Memory Module is a variation of DLL injection where the DLL is mapped into the process memory, allowing execution without using additional APIs)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CREATE REMOTE THREAD<|>EVENT<|>CreateRemoteThread is a Windows API function used to create a new thread in a remote process, often used in DLL injection techniques)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LOAD LIBRARY<|>EVENT<|>LoadLibrary is a Windows API function responsible for loading DLLs into the address space of a process, commonly used in DLL injection techniques)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VIRTUAL ALLOC EX<|>EVENT<|>VirtualAllocEx is a Windows API function used to allocate memory in the address space of a specified process, often used in DLL injection techniques)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WRITE PROCESS MEMORY<|>EVENT<|>WriteProcessMemory is a Windows API function used to write data to the memory of a specified process, often used in DLL injection techniques)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ELASTIC<|>DLL INJECTION<|>Elastic provides insights and research on DLL injection techniques<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WINDOWS API<|>DLL INJECTION<|>DLL injection techniques often use Windows API functions like VirtualAllocEx and WriteProcessMemory<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MODULE STOMPING<|>DLL INJECTION<|>Module Stomping is a variation of DLL injection used to conceal injected code<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>REFLECTIVE DLL INJECTION<|>DLL INJECTION<|>Reflective DLL Injection is a variation of DLL injection that addresses address relocation issues<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MEMORY MODULE<|>DLL INJECTION<|>Memory Module is a variation of DLL injection that maps the DLL into process memory<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CREATE REMOTE THREAD<|>DLL INJECTION<|>CreateRemoteThread is a Windows API function used to invoke DLL injection<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LOAD LIBRARY<|>DLL INJECTION<|>LoadLibrary is a Windows API function used to load DLLs in DLL injection techniques<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>VIRTUAL ALLOC EX<|>DLL INJECTION<|>VirtualAllocEx is a Windows API function used to allocate memory for DLL injection<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WRITE PROCESS MEMORY<|>DLL INJECTION<|>WriteProcessMemory is a Windows API function used to write DLL paths in DLL injection<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
