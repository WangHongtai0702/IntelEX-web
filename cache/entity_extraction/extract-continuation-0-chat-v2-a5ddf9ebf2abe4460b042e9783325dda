For example, an adversary may enable features such as concurrent [Remote Desktop Protocol](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1021/001) sessions by either patching the <code>termsrv.dll</code> file or modifying the <code>ServiceDll</code> value to point to a DLL that provides increased RDP functionality.(Citation: Windows OS Hub RDP)(Citation: RDPWrap Github) On a non-server Windows OS this increased functionality may also enable an adversary to avoid Terminal Services prompts that warn/log out users of a system when a new RDP session is created.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>MICROSOFT TERMINAL SERVICES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Microsoft Terminal Services, renamed to Remote Desktop Services in some Windows Server OSs as of 2022, enable remote terminal connections to hosts and allow servers to transmit a full, interactive, graphical user interface to clients via RDP)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>REMOTE DESKTOP SERVICES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Remote Desktop Services is the new name for Microsoft Terminal Services in some Windows Server OSs as of 2022, providing remote terminal connections to hosts)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TERMINAL SERVICES DLL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The DLL file used by Terminal Services, typically stored in `%SystemRoot%\\System32\\`, which can be modified or replaced by adversaries to enable persistent access to victimized hosts)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TERMSRV.DLL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The default ServiceDll value for Terminal Services in `HKLM\\System\\CurrentControlSet\\services\\TermService\\Parameters\\`, which can be patched or modified to provide increased RDP functionality)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>REMOTE DESKTOP PROTOCOL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A protocol used by Terminal Services to transmit a full, interactive, graphical user interface to clients)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WINDOWS OS HUB<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A source cited for information on RDP functionality and modifications)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RDPWRAP GITHUB<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A source cited for information on RDP functionality and modifications)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JAMES<|>PERSON<|>An individual cited for information on modifications to the Terminal Services DLL)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MICROSOFT SYSTEM SERVICES FUNDAMENTALS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A source cited for information on Windows services and their DLL files)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WINDOWS SERVICE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A service in Windows that runs as a \"generic\" process and loads the service's DLL file, the location of which is stored in a Registry entry named `ServiceDll`)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MICROSOFT TERMINAL SERVICES<|>REMOTE DESKTOP SERVICES<|>Remote Desktop Services is the new name for Microsoft Terminal Services in some Windows Server OSs as of 2022<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MICROSOFT TERMINAL SERVICES<|>TERMINAL SERVICES DLL<|>Terminal Services DLL is used by Microsoft Terminal Services to enable remote terminal connections<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TERMINAL SERVICES DLL<|>TERMSRV.DLL<|>termsrv.dll is the default ServiceDll value for Terminal Services<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MICROSOFT TERMINAL SERVICES<|>REMOTE DESKTOP PROTOCOL<|>Microsoft Terminal Services uses Remote Desktop Protocol to transmit a graphical user interface to clients<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TERMINAL SERVICES DLL<|>REMOTE DESKTOP PROTOCOL<|>Terminal Services DLL can be modified to provide increased RDP functionality<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TERMINAL SERVICES DLL<|>WINDOWS OS HUB<|>Windows OS Hub is a source cited for information on modifications to Terminal Services DLL<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TERMINAL SERVICES DLL<|>RDPWRAP GITHUB<|>RDPWrap Github is a source cited for information on modifications to Terminal Services DLL<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TERMINAL SERVICES DLL<|>JAMES<|>James is cited for information on modifications to Terminal Services DLL<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MICROSOFT TERMINAL SERVICES<|>MICROSOFT SYSTEM SERVICES FUNDAMENTALS<|>Microsoft System Services Fundamentals is a source cited for information on Microsoft Terminal Services<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MICROSOFT TERMINAL SERVICES<|>WINDOWS SERVICE<|>Windows Service is a service in Windows that runs as a \"generic\" process and loads the service's DLL file<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
