Because some programs do not call other programs using the full path, adversaries may place their own file in the directory where the calling program is located, causing the operating system to launch their malicious software at the request of the calling program.\n\nSearch order hijacking occurs when an adversary abuses the order in which Windows searches for programs that are not given a path. Unlike [DLL Search Order Hijacking](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/001), the search order differs depending on the method that is used to execute the program. (Citation: Microsoft CreateProcess) (Citation: Windows NT Command Shell) (Citation: Microsoft WinExec) However, it is common for Windows to search in the directory of the initiating program before searching through the Windows system directory. An adversary who finds a program vulnerable to search order hijacking (i.e., a program that does not specify the path to an executable) may take advantage of this vulnerability by creating a program named after the improperly specified program and placing it within the initiating program's directory.\n\nFor example, \"example.exe\" runs \"cmd.exe\" with the command-line argument <code>net user</code>. An adversary may place a program called \"net.exe\" within the same directory as example.exe, \"net.exe\" will be run instead of the Windows system utility net. In addition, if an adversary places a program called \"net.com\" in the same directory as \"net.exe\", then <code>cmd.exe /C net user</code> will execute \"net.com\" instead of \"net.exe\" due to the order of executable extensions defined under PATHEXT. (Citation: Microsoft Environment Property)\n\nSearch order hijacking is also a common practice for hijacking DLL loads and is covered in [DLL Search Order Hijacking](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/001).\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>MICROSOFT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Microsoft is a technology company that provides various software and services, including the Windows operating system)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WINDOWS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Windows is an operating system developed by Microsoft, commonly used in personal computers and enterprise environments)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WINDOWS NT COMMAND SHELL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Windows NT Command Shell is a command-line interpreter application available in Windows operating systems)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WINEXEC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>WinExec is a function in the Windows API that runs a specified application)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DLL SEARCH ORDER HIJACKING<|>EVENT<|>DLL Search Order Hijacking is a technique where adversaries exploit the order in which Windows searches for Dynamic Link Libraries (DLLs) to load malicious code)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CREATEPROCESS<|>EVENT<|>CreateProcess is a function in the Windows API that creates a new process and its primary thread)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PATHEXT<|>EVENT<|>PATHEXT is an environment variable in Windows that defines the executable file extensions)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MICROSOFT<|>WINDOWS<|>Microsoft is the developer of the Windows operating system<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WINDOWS<|>WINDOWS NT COMMAND SHELL<|>The Windows NT Command Shell is a component of the Windows operating system<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WINDOWS<|>WINEXEC<|>WinExec is a function used within the Windows operating system<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DLL SEARCH ORDER HIJACKING<|>WINDOWS<|>DLL Search Order Hijacking is a technique that exploits the Windows operating system<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CREATEPROCESS<|>WINDOWS<|>CreateProcess is a function used within the Windows operating system<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PATHEXT<|>WINDOWS<|>PATHEXT is an environment variable used within the Windows operating system<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
