Asymmetric cryptography, also known as public key cryptography, uses a keypair per party: one public that can be freely distributed, and one private. Due to how the keys are generated, the sender encrypts data with the receiver’s public key and the receiver decrypts the data with their private key. This ensures that only the intended recipient can read the encrypted data. Common public key encryption algorithms include RSA and ElGamal.\n\nFor efficiency, many protocols (including SSL/TLS) use symmetric cryptography once a connection is established, but use asymmetric cryptography to establish or transmit a key. As such, these protocols are classified as [Asymmetric Cryptography](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1573/002).\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>RSA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>RSA is a common public key encryption algorithm used in asymmetric cryptography)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ELGAMAL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>ElGamal is a common public key encryption algorithm used in asymmetric cryptography)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SSL/TLS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>SSL/TLS are protocols that use symmetric cryptography once a connection is established but use asymmetric cryptography to establish or transmit a key)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ASYMMETRIC CRYPTOGRAPHY<|>EVENT<|>Asymmetric cryptography, also known as public key cryptography, uses a keypair per party: one public that can be freely distributed, and one private)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SYMMETRIC CRYPTOGRAPHY<|>EVENT<|>Symmetric cryptography is used for efficiency in many protocols once a connection is established)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RSA<|>ASYMMETRIC CRYPTOGRAPHY<|>RSA is a common algorithm used in asymmetric cryptography<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ELGAMAL<|>ASYMMETRIC CRYPTOGRAPHY<|>ElGamal is a common algorithm used in asymmetric cryptography<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SSL/TLS<|>ASYMMETRIC CRYPTOGRAPHY<|>SSL/TLS use asymmetric cryptography to establish or transmit a key<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SSL/TLS<|>SYMMETRIC CRYPTOGRAPHY<|>SSL/TLS use symmetric cryptography once a connection is established<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
