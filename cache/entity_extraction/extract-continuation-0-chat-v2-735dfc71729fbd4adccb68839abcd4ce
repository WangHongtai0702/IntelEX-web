When Windows boots up, it starts programs or applications called services that perform background system functions.(Citation: TechNet Services) Windows service configuration information, including the file path to the service's executable or recovery programs/commands, is stored in the Windows Registry.\n\nAdversaries may install a new service or modify an existing service to execute at startup in order to persist on a system. Service configurations can be set or modified using system utilities (such as sc.exe), by directly modifying the Registry, or by interacting directly with the Windows API. \n\nAdversaries may also use services to install and execute malicious drivers. For example, after dropping a driver file (ex: `.sys`) to disk, the payload can be loaded and registered via [Native API](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1106) functions such as `CreateServiceW()` (or manually via functions such as `ZwLoadDriver()` and `ZwSetValueKey()`), by creating the required service Registry values (i.e. [Modify Registry](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1112)), or by using command-line utilities such as `PnPUtil.exe`.(Citation: Symantec W.32 Stuxnet Dossier)(Citation: Crowdstrike DriveSlayer February 2022)(Citation: Unit42 AcidBox June 2020) Adversaries may leverage these drivers as [Rootkit](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1014)s to hide the presence of malicious activity on a system. Adversaries may also load a signed yet vulnerable driver onto a compromised machine (known as \"Bring Your Own Vulnerable Driver\" (BYOVD)) as part of [Exploitation for Privilege Escalation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1068).(Citation: ESET InvisiMole June 2020)(Citation: Unit42 AcidBox June 2020)\n\nServices may be created with administrator privileges but are executed under SYSTEM privileges, so an adversary may also use a service to escalate privileges. Adversaries may also directly start services through [Service Execution](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1569/002).\n\nTo make detection analysis more challenging, malicious services may also incorporate [Masquerade Task or Service](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1036/004) (ex: using a service and/or payload name related to a legitimate OS or benign software component). Adversaries may also create ‘hidden’ services (i.e., [Hide Artifacts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1564)), for example by using the `sc sdset` command to set service permissions via the Service Descriptor Definition Language (SDDL). This may hide a Windows service from the view of standard service enumeration methods such as `Get-Service`, `sc query`, and `services.exe`.(Citation: SANS 1)(Citation: SANS 2)\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>TECHNET SERVICES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>TechNet Services is a source of information on Windows services and their configurations)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SYMANTEC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Symantec is a cybersecurity company that provided information on the W.32 Stuxnet Dossier)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CROWDSTRIKE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Crowdstrike is a cybersecurity firm that reported on DriveSlayer in February 2022)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UNIT42<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Unit42 is a cybersecurity research team that reported on AcidBox in June 2020)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ESET<|>ORGANIZATION<|>ESET is a cybersecurity company that reported on InvisiMole in June 2020)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SANS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>SANS is an organization that provided information on hidden services and service permissions)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WINDOWS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Windows is an operating system developed by Microsoft, which includes services that perform background system functions)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STUXNET<|>EVENT<|>Stuxnet is a malicious computer worm first uncovered in 2010, which targeted supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DRIVESLAYER<|>EVENT<|>DriveSlayer is a malicious activity reported by Crowdstrike in February 2022)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ACIDBOX<|>EVENT<|>AcidBox is a malicious activity reported by Unit42 in June 2020)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INVISIMOLE<|>EVENT<|>InvisiMole is a malicious activity reported by ESET in June 2020)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SYMANTEC<|>STUXNET<|>Symantec provided detailed information on the W.32 Stuxnet Dossier<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CROWDSTRIKE<|>DRIVESLAYER<|>Crowdstrike reported on DriveSlayer in February 2022<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>UNIT42<|>ACIDBOX<|>Unit42 reported on AcidBox in June 2020<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ESET<|>INVISIMOLE<|>ESET reported on InvisiMole in June 2020<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SANS<|>WINDOWS<|>SANS provided information on hidden services and service permissions in Windows<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
