Ptrace system call injection is a method of executing arbitrary code in the address space of a separate live process. \n\nPtrace system call injection involves attaching to and modifying a running process. The ptrace system call enables a debugging process to observe and control another process (and each individual thread), including changing memory and register values.(Citation: PTRACE man) Ptrace system call injection is commonly performed by writing arbitrary code into a running process (ex: <code>malloc</code>) then invoking that memory with <code>PTRACE_SETREGS</code> to set the register containing the next instruction to execute. Ptrace system call injection can also be done with <code>PTRACE_POKETEXT</code>/<code>PTRACE_POKEDATA</code>, which copy data to a specific address in the target processesâ€™ memory (ex: the current address of the next instruction). (Citation: PTRACE man)(Citation: Medium Ptrace JUL 2018) \n\nPtrace system call injection may not be possible targeting processes that are non-child processes and/or have higher-privileges.(Citation: BH Linux Inject) \n\nRunning code in the context of another process may allow access to the process's memory, system/network resources, and possibly elevated privileges. Execution via ptrace system call injection may also evade detection from security products since the execution is masked under a legitimate process.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>PTRACE<|>EVENT<|>Ptrace is a system call used for debugging processes by observing and controlling another process, including changing memory and register values)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PTRACE SYSTEM CALL INJECTION<|>EVENT<|>Ptrace system call injection is a method of executing arbitrary code in the address space of a separate live process by attaching to and modifying a running process)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MALLOC<|>EVENT<|>Malloc is a function used to allocate memory in a running process, which can be used in ptrace system call injection)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PTRACE_SETREGS<|>EVENT<|>Ptrace_setregs is a ptrace command used to set the register containing the next instruction to execute in a running process)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PTRACE_POKETEXT<|>EVENT<|>Ptrace_poketext is a ptrace command used to copy data to a specific address in the target process's memory)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PTRACE_POKEDATA<|>EVENT<|>Ptrace_pokedata is a ptrace command used to copy data to a specific address in the target process's memory)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BH LINUX INJECT<|>EVENT<|>BH Linux Inject is a reference to a source discussing the limitations of ptrace system call injection, particularly when targeting non-child processes and/or processes with higher privileges)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PTRACE<|>PTRACE SYSTEM CALL INJECTION<|>Ptrace is the system call used in ptrace system call injection to execute arbitrary code in another process<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PTRACE SYSTEM CALL INJECTION<|>MALLOC<|>Malloc is used in ptrace system call injection to allocate memory in a running process<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PTRACE SYSTEM CALL INJECTION<|>PTRACE_SETREGS<|>Ptrace_setregs is used in ptrace system call injection to set the register containing the next instruction to execute<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PTRACE SYSTEM CALL INJECTION<|>PTRACE_POKETEXT<|>Ptrace_poketext is used in ptrace system call injection to copy data to a specific address in the target process's memory<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PTRACE SYSTEM CALL INJECTION<|>PTRACE_POKEDATA<|>Ptrace_pokedata is used in ptrace system call injection to copy data to a specific address in the target process's memory<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PTRACE SYSTEM CALL INJECTION<|>BH LINUX INJECT<|>BH Linux Inject discusses the limitations of ptrace system call injection<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
