Various command interpreters keep track of the commands users type in their terminal so that users can retrace what they've done. \n\nOn Linux and macOS, command history is tracked in a file pointed to by the environment variable <code>HISTFILE</code>. When a user logs off a system, this information is flushed to a file in the user's home directory called <code>~/.bash_history</code>. The <code>HISTCONTROL</code> environment variable keeps track of what should be saved by the <code>history</code> command and eventually into the <code>~/.bash_history</code> file when a user logs out. <code>HISTCONTROL</code> does not exist by default on macOS, but can be set by the user and will be respected.\n\nAdversaries may clear the history environment variable (<code>unset HISTFILE</code>) or set the command history size to zero (<code>export HISTFILESIZE=0</code>) to prevent logging of commands. Additionally, <code>HISTCONTROL</code> can be configured to ignore commands that start with a space by simply setting it to \"ignorespace\". <code>HISTCONTROL</code> can also be set to ignore duplicate commands by setting it to \"ignoredups\". In some Linux systems, this is set by default to \"ignoreboth\" which covers both of the previous examples. This means that “ ls” will not be saved, but “ls” would be saved by history. Adversaries can abuse this to operate without leaving traces by simply prepending a space to all of their terminal commands. \n\nOn Windows systems, the <code>PSReadLine</code> module tracks commands used in all PowerShell sessions and writes them to a file (<code>$env:APPDATA\\Microsoft\\Windows\\PowerShell\\PSReadLine\\ConsoleHost_history.txt</code> by default). Adversaries may change where these logs are saved using <code>Set-PSReadLineOption -HistorySavePath {File Path}</code>. This will cause <code>ConsoleHost_history.txt</code> to stop receiving logs. Additionally, it is possible to turn off logging to this file using the PowerShell command <code>Set-PSReadlineOption -HistorySaveStyle SaveNothing</code>.(Citation: Microsoft PowerShell Command History)(Citation: Sophos PowerShell command audit)(Citation: Sophos PowerShell Command History Forensics)\n\nAdversaries may also leverage a [Network Device CLI](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/008) on network devices to disable historical command logging (e.g. <code>no logging</code>).\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>LINUX<|>GEO<|>Linux is an open-source operating system used for various computing tasks, including command history logging)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MACOS<|>GEO<|>macOS is an operating system developed by Apple Inc. that also tracks command history in a file)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WINDOWS<|>GEO<|>Windows is an operating system developed by Microsoft that uses the PSReadLine module to track command history)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PSREADLINE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>PSReadLine is a module in Windows PowerShell that tracks commands used in all PowerShell sessions)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MICROSOFT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Microsoft is the developer of the Windows operating system and PowerShell)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SOPHOS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Sophos is a cybersecurity company that provides insights and audits on PowerShell command history)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NETWORK DEVICE CLI<|>EVENT<|>Network Device CLI is a command-line interface used on network devices that can be leveraged to disable historical command logging)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LINUX<|>MACOS<|>Both Linux and macOS track command history in a file<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WINDOWS<|>PSREADLINE<|>PSReadLine is a module in Windows PowerShell that tracks command history<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MICROSOFT<|>WINDOWS<|>Microsoft is the developer of the Windows operating system<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MICROSOFT<|>PSREADLINE<|>Microsoft developed the PSReadLine module for PowerShell<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SOPHOS<|>WINDOWS<|>Sophos provides audits and insights on PowerShell command history in Windows<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NETWORK DEVICE CLI<|>LINUX<|>Network Device CLI can be used on Linux systems to disable historical command logging<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NETWORK DEVICE CLI<|>MACOS<|>Network Device CLI can be used on macOS systems to disable historical command logging<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NETWORK DEVICE CLI<|>WINDOWS<|>Network Device CLI can be used on Windows systems to disable historical command logging<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
