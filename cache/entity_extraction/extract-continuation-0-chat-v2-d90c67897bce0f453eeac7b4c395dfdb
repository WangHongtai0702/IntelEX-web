These files allow system administrators to map and start custom services at startup for different run levels. RC scripts require root privileges to modify.\n\nAdversaries can establish persistence by adding a malicious binary path or shell commands to <code>rc.local</code>, <code>rc.common</code>, and other RC scripts specific to the Unix-like distribution.(Citation: IranThreats Kittens Dec 2017)(Citation: Intezer HiddenWasp Map 2019) Upon reboot, the system executes the script's contents as root, resulting in persistence.\n\nAdversary abuse of RC scripts is especially effective for lightweight Unix-like distributions using the root user as default, such as IoT or embedded systems.(Citation: intezer-kaiji-malware)\n\nSeveral Unix-like systems have moved to Systemd and deprecated the use of RC scripts. This is now a deprecated mechanism in macOS in favor of [Launchd](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1053/004). (Citation: Apple Developer Doco Archive Launchd)(Citation: Startup Items) This technique can be used on Mac OS X Panther v10.3 and earlier versions which still execute the RC scripts.(Citation: Methods of Mac Malware Persistence) To maintain backwards compatibility some systems, such as Ubuntu, will execute the RC scripts if they exist with the correct file permissions.(Citation: Ubuntu Manpage systemd rc)\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>IRANTHREATS KITTENS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>IranThreats Kittens is an organization mentioned in the context of modifying RC scripts for persistence in Unix-like systems<|>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INTEZER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Intezer is an organization cited for its work on HiddenWasp malware<|>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>APPLE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Apple is a company mentioned in the context of deprecating RC scripts in favor of Launchd<|>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UBUNTU<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Ubuntu is a Unix-like distribution that maintains backwards compatibility with RC scripts<|>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MAC OS X PANTHER<|>EVENT<|>Mac OS X Panther v10.3 is an older version of macOS that still executes RC scripts<|>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SYSTEMD<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Systemd is a system and service manager for Unix-like operating systems that has deprecated the use of RC scripts<|>)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LAUNCHD<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Launchd is a system used by macOS to replace RC scripts<|>)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>IRANTHREATS KITTENS<|>RC SCRIPTS<|>IranThreats Kittens is mentioned in the context of modifying RC scripts for persistence<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>INTEZER<|>HIDDENWASP<|>Intezer is cited for its work on HiddenWasp malware<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>APPLE<|>LAUNCHD<|>Apple has deprecated RC scripts in favor of Launchd<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>UBUNTU<|>RC SCRIPTS<|>Ubuntu maintains backwards compatibility with RC scripts<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MAC OS X PANTHER<|>RC SCRIPTS<|>Mac OS X Panther v10.3 still executes RC scripts<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SYSTEMD<|>RC SCRIPTS<|>Systemd has deprecated the use of RC scripts<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
