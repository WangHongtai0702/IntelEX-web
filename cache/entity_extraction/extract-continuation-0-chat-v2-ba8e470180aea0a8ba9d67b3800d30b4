Process command-line arguments are stored in the process environment block (PEB), a data structure used by Windows to store various information about/used by a process. The PEB includes the process command-line arguments that are referenced when executing the process. When a process is created, defensive tools/sensors that monitor process creations may retrieve the process arguments from the PEB.(Citation: Microsoft PEB 2021)(Citation: Xpn Argue Like Cobalt 2019)\n\nAdversaries may manipulate a process PEB to evade defenses. For example, [Process Hollowing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1055/012) can be abused to spawn a process in a suspended state with benign arguments. After the process is spawned and the PEB is initialized (and process information is potentially logged by tools/sensors), adversaries may override the PEB to modify the command-line arguments (ex: using the [Native API](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1106) <code>WriteProcessMemory()</code> function) then resume process execution with malicious arguments.(Citation: Cobalt Strike Arguments 2019)(Citation: Xpn Argue Like Cobalt 2019)(Citation: Nviso Spoof Command Line 2020)\n\nAdversaries may also execute a process with malicious command-line arguments then patch the memory with benign arguments that may bypass subsequent process memory analysis.(Citation: FireEye FiveHands April 2021)\n\nThis behavior may also be combined with other tricks (such as [Parent PID Spoofing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1134/004)) to manipulate or further evade process-based detections.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>MICROSOFT PEB 2021<|>EVENT<|>A citation referring to information about the Process Environment Block (PEB) used by Windows, published in 2021)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>XPN ARGUE LIKE COBALT 2019<|>EVENT<|>A citation referring to a 2019 publication discussing techniques similar to those used by Cobalt Strike)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COBALT STRIKE ARGUMENTS 2019<|>EVENT<|>A citation referring to a 2019 publication about Cobalt Strike's use of command-line arguments)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NVISO SPOOF COMMAND LINE 2020<|>EVENT<|>A citation referring to a 2020 publication by Nviso about spoofing command-line arguments)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FIREEYE FIVEHANDS APRIL 2021<|>EVENT<|>A citation referring to an April 2021 publication by FireEye about the FiveHands malware)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PROCESS HOLLOWING<|>EVENT<|>A technique where a process is spawned in a suspended state with benign arguments, which are later modified to malicious ones)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NATIVE API<|>EVENT<|>A set of Windows API functions, including WriteProcessMemory(), used to manipulate process memory)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PARENT PID SPOOFING<|>EVENT<|>A technique used to manipulate or evade process-based detections by spoofing the parent process ID)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MICROSOFT PEB 2021<|>PEB<|>The Microsoft PEB 2021 citation provides information about the Process Environment Block (PEB)<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>XPN ARGUE LIKE COBALT 2019<|>PEB<|>The Xpn Argue Like Cobalt 2019 citation discusses techniques related to manipulating the PEB<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>COBALT STRIKE ARGUMENTS 2019<|>PEB<|>The Cobalt Strike Arguments 2019 citation discusses the use of command-line arguments in the PEB<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NVISO SPOOF COMMAND LINE 2020<|>PEB<|>The Nviso Spoof Command Line 2020 citation discusses spoofing command-line arguments in the PEB<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FIREEYE FIVEHANDS APRIL 2021<|>PEB<|>The FireEye FiveHands April 2021 citation discusses malware that manipulates the PEB<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PROCESS HOLLOWING<|>PEB<|>Process Hollowing is a technique that involves manipulating the PEB<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NATIVE API<|>PEB<|>The Native API includes functions like WriteProcessMemory() that can be used to manipulate the PEB<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PARENT PID SPOOFING<|>PEB<|>Parent PID Spoofing can be used in conjunction with PEB manipulation to evade detections<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
