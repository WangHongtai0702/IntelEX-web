These tokens are typically stolen from users or services and used in lieu of login credentials.\n\nApplication access tokens are used to make authorized API requests on behalf of a user or service and are commonly used to access resources in cloud, container-based applications, and software-as-a-service (SaaS).(Citation: Auth0 - Why You Should Always Use Access Tokens to Secure APIs Sept 2019) \n\nOAuth is one commonly implemented framework that issues tokens to users for access to systems. These frameworks are used collaboratively to verify the user and determine what actions the user is allowed to perform. Once identity is established, the token allows actions to be authorized, without passing the actual credentials of the user. Therefore, compromise of the token can grant the adversary access to resources of other sites through a malicious application.(Citation: okta)\n\nFor example, with a cloud-based email service, once an OAuth access token is granted to a malicious application, it can potentially gain long-term access to features of the user account if a \"refresh\" token enabling background access is awarded.(Citation: Microsoft Identity Platform Access 2019) With an OAuth access token an adversary can use the user-granted REST API to perform functions such as email searching and contact enumeration.(Citation: Staaldraad Phishing with OAuth 2017)\n\nCompromised access tokens may be used as an initial step in compromising other services. For example, if a token grants access to a victim’s primary email, the adversary may be able to extend access to all other services which the target subscribes by triggering forgotten password routines. In AWS and GCP environments, adversaries can trigger a request for a short-lived access token with the privileges of another user account.(Citation: Google Cloud Service Account Credentials)(Citation: AWS Temporary Security Credentials) The adversary can then use this token to request data or perform actions the original account could not. If permissions for this feature are misconfigured – for example, by allowing all users to request a token for a particular account - an adversary may be able to gain initial access to a Cloud Account or escalate their privileges.(Citation: Rhino Security Labs Enumerating AWS Roles)\n\nDirect API access through a token negates the effectiveness of a second authentication factor and may be immune to intuitive countermeasures like changing passwords.  For example, in AWS environments, an adversary who compromises a user’s AWS API credentials may be able to use the `sts:GetFederationToken` API call to create a federated user session, which will have the same permissions as the original user but may persist even if the original user credentials are deactivated.(Citation: Crowdstrike AWS User Federation Persistence) Additionally, access abuse over an API channel can be difficult to detect even from the service provider end, as the access can still align well with a legitimate workflow.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>AUTH0<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Auth0 is a company that provides authentication and authorization services, and has published information on the importance of using access tokens to secure APIs)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OKTA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Okta is an identity and access management company that provides information on OAuth frameworks and their security implications)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MICROSOFT IDENTITY PLATFORM<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Microsoft Identity Platform provides identity and access management services, including OAuth access tokens for cloud-based email services)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STAALDRAAD<|>PERSON<|>Staaldraad is an individual or entity that has published information on phishing attacks using OAuth tokens)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GOOGLE CLOUD<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Google Cloud provides cloud computing services and has documentation on service account credentials and security)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AWS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Amazon Web Services (AWS) provides cloud computing services and has documentation on temporary security credentials and API calls)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RHINO SECURITY LABS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Rhino Security Labs is a security research firm that has published information on enumerating AWS roles and security practices)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CROWDSTRIKE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Crowdstrike is a cybersecurity technology company that has published information on AWS user federation persistence)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AUTH0<|>OKTA<|>Both Auth0 and Okta provide information and services related to authentication and authorization, including the use of access tokens<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MICROSOFT IDENTITY PLATFORM<|>STAALDRAAD<|>Staaldraad has published information on phishing attacks using OAuth tokens, which are also managed by the Microsoft Identity Platform<|>4)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GOOGLE CLOUD<|>AWS<|>Both Google Cloud and AWS provide cloud computing services and have documentation on security practices related to access tokens<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RHINO SECURITY LABS<|>AWS<|>Rhino Security Labs has published information on enumerating AWS roles and security practices<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CROWDSTRIKE<|>AWS<|>Crowdstrike has published information on AWS user federation persistence<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
