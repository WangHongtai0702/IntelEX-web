Malicious modifications to NAT may enable an adversary to bypass restrictions on traffic routing that otherwise separate trusted and untrusted networks.\n\nNetwork devices such as routers and firewalls that connect multiple networks together may implement NAT during the process of passing packets between networks. When performing NAT, the network device will rewrite the source and/or destination addresses of the IP address header. Some network designs require NAT for the packets to cross the border device.  A typical example of this is environments where internal networks make use of non-Internet routable addresses.(Citation: RFC1918)\n\nWhen an adversary gains control of a network boundary device, they can either leverage existing NAT configurations to send traffic between two separated networks, or they can implement NAT configurations of their own design.  In the case of network designs that require NAT to function, this enables the adversary to overcome inherent routing limitations that would normally prevent them from accessing protected systems behind the border device.  In the case of network designs that do not require NAT, address translation can be used by adversaries to obscure their activities, as changing the addresses of packets that traverse a network boundary device can make monitoring data transmissions more challenging for defenders.  \n\nAdversaries may use [Patch System Image](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1601/001) to change the operating system of a network device, implementing their own custom NAT mechanisms to further obscure their activities\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>NETWORK DEVICE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Network devices such as routers and firewalls connect multiple networks together and may implement Network Address Translation (NAT) during the process of passing packets between networks)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NAT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Network Address Translation (NAT) is a method used by network devices to rewrite the source and/or destination addresses of the IP address header to enable traffic routing between different networks)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RFC1918<|>EVENT<|>RFC1918 is a standard that defines the use of non-Internet routable addresses in internal networks)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PATCH SYSTEM IMAGE<|>EVENT<|>Patch System Image is a technique used by adversaries to change the operating system of a network device, implementing their own custom NAT mechanisms to obscure their activities)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NETWORK DEVICE<|>NAT<|>Network devices implement NAT to rewrite IP address headers and enable traffic routing between different networks<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NAT<|>RFC1918<|>NAT is often used in environments where internal networks make use of non-Internet routable addresses as defined by RFC1918<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PATCH SYSTEM IMAGE<|>NAT<|>Adversaries may use Patch System Image to change the operating system of a network device and implement custom NAT mechanisms<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
