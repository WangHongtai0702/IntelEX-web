Exploitation of a software vulnerability occurs when an adversary takes advantage of a programming error in a program, service, or within the operating system software or kernel itself to execute adversary-controlled code. Security constructs such as permission levels will often hinder access to information and use of certain techniques, so adversaries will likely need to perform privilege escalation to include use of software exploitation to circumvent those restrictions.\n\nWhen initially gaining access to a system, an adversary may be operating within a lower privileged process which will prevent them from accessing certain resources on the system. Vulnerabilities may exist, usually in operating system components and software commonly running at higher permissions, that can be exploited to gain higher levels of access on the system. This could enable someone to move from unprivileged or user level permissions to SYSTEM or root permissions depending on the component that is vulnerable. This could also enable an adversary to move from a virtualized environment, such as within a virtual machine or container, onto the underlying host. This may be a necessary step for an adversary compromising an endpoint system that has been properly configured and limits other privilege escalation methods.\n\nAdversaries may bring a signed vulnerable driver onto a compromised machine so that they can exploit the vulnerability to execute code in kernel mode. This process is sometimes referred to as Bring Your Own Vulnerable Driver (BYOVD).(Citation: ESET InvisiMole June 2020)(Citation: Unit42 AcidBox June 2020) Adversaries may include the vulnerable driver with files delivered during Initial Access or download it to a compromised system via [Ingress Tool Transfer](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1105) or [Lateral Tool Transfer](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1570).\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ESET INVISIMOLE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>ESET InvisiMole is a cybersecurity firm that reported on the Bring Your Own Vulnerable Driver (BYOVD) technique in June 2020)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UNIT42 ACIDBOX<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Unit42 AcidBox is a cybersecurity research group that reported on the Bring Your Own Vulnerable Driver (BYOVD) technique in June 2020)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SYSTEM<|>GEO<|>A system refers to a computer or network that adversaries may attempt to gain higher levels of access to by exploiting software vulnerabilities)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROOT<|>GEO<|>Root permissions refer to the highest level of access in a Unix-like operating system, which adversaries may attempt to gain through privilege escalation)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VIRTUAL MACHINE<|>GEO<|>A virtual machine is a software-based emulation of a computer that adversaries may attempt to escape from to access the underlying host system)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CONTAINER<|>GEO<|>A container is a lightweight, standalone, executable package of software that includes everything needed to run it, which adversaries may attempt to escape from to access the underlying host system)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HOST<|>GEO<|>The host refers to the underlying physical or virtual machine that runs virtual machines or containers, which adversaries may attempt to access by escaping from a virtualized environment)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ENDPOINT SYSTEM<|>GEO<|>An endpoint system is a device such as a computer or workstation that adversaries may target for compromise and privilege escalation)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KERNEL<|>GEO<|>The kernel is the core part of an operating system that manages system resources and communication between hardware and software, which adversaries may target for privilege escalation)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BRING YOUR OWN VULNERABLE DRIVER (BYOVD)<|>EVENT<|>Bring Your Own Vulnerable Driver (BYOVD) is a technique where adversaries bring a signed vulnerable driver onto a compromised machine to exploit it and execute code in kernel mode)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ESET INVISIMOLE<|>BRING YOUR OWN VULNERABLE DRIVER (BYOVD)<|>ESET InvisiMole reported on the Bring Your Own Vulnerable Driver (BYOVD) technique in June 2020<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>UNIT42 ACIDBOX<|>BRING YOUR OWN VULNERABLE DRIVER (BYOVD)<|>Unit42 AcidBox reported on the Bring Your Own Vulnerable Driver (BYOVD) technique in June 2020<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SYSTEM<|>ROOT<|>Adversaries may attempt to gain root permissions on a system by exploiting software vulnerabilities<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>VIRTUAL MACHINE<|>HOST<|>Adversaries may attempt to escape from a virtual machine to access the underlying host system<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CONTAINER<|>HOST<|>Adversaries may attempt to escape from a container to access the underlying host system<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ENDPOINT SYSTEM<|>KERNEL<|>Adversaries may target the kernel of an endpoint system for privilege escalation<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
