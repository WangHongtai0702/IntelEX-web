Code signing provides a level of authenticity on a program from a developer and a guarantee that the program has not been tampered with. Security controls can include enforcement mechanisms to ensure that only valid, signed code can be run on an operating system. \n\nSome of these security controls may be enabled by default, such as Driver Signature Enforcement (DSE) on Windows or System Integrity Protection (SIP) on macOS.(Citation: Microsoft DSE June 2017)(Citation: Apple Disable SIP) Other such controls may be disabled by default but are configurable through application controls, such as only allowing signed Dynamic-Link Libraries (DLLs) to execute on a system. Since it can be useful for developers to modify default signature enforcement policies during the development and testing of applications, disabling of these features may be possible with elevated permissions.(Citation: Microsoft Unsigned Driver Apr 2017)(Citation: Apple Disable SIP)\n\nAdversaries may modify code signing policies in a number of ways, including through use of command-line or GUI utilities, [Modify Registry](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1112), rebooting the computer in a debug/recovery mode, or by altering the value of variables in kernel memory.(Citation: Microsoft TESTSIGNING Feb 2021)(Citation: Apple Disable SIP)(Citation: FireEye HIKIT Rootkit Part 2)(Citation: GitHub Turla Driver Loader) Examples of commands that can modify the code signing policy of a system include <code>bcdedit.exe -set TESTSIGNING ON</code> on Windows and <code>csrutil disable</code> on macOS.(Citation: Microsoft TESTSIGNING Feb 2021)(Citation: Apple Disable SIP) Depending on the implementation, successful modification of a signing policy may require reboot of the compromised system. Additionally, some implementations can introduce visible artifacts for the user (ex: a watermark in the corner of the screen stating the system is in Test Mode). Adversaries may attempt to remove such artifacts.(Citation: F-Secure BlackEnergy 2014)\n\nTo gain access to kernel memory to modify variables related to signature checks, such as modifying <code>g_CiOptions</code> to disable Driver Signature Enforcement, adversaries may conduct [Exploitation for Privilege Escalation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1068) using a signed, but vulnerable driver.(Citation: Unit42 AcidBox June 2020)(Citation: GitHub Turla Driver Loader)\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>MICROSOFT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Microsoft is a technology company that provides various software and hardware products, including the Windows operating system, which has security features like Driver Signature Enforcement (DSE).)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>APPLE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Apple is a technology company known for its macOS operating system, which includes security features like System Integrity Protection (SIP).)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FIREEYE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>FireEye is a cybersecurity company that has reported on various security threats, including the HIKIT Rootkit.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>F-SECURE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>F-Secure is a cybersecurity company that has reported on threats like BlackEnergy.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UNIT42<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Unit42 is a cybersecurity research team that has reported on threats like AcidBox.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GITHUB<|>ORGANIZATION<|>GitHub is a platform for version control and collaboration, which hosts repositories like the Turla Driver Loader.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WINDOWS<|>GEO<|>Windows is an operating system developed by Microsoft, which includes security features like Driver Signature Enforcement (DSE).)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MACOS<|>GEO<|>macOS is an operating system developed by Apple, which includes security features like System Integrity Protection (SIP).)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DSE<|>EVENT<|>Driver Signature Enforcement (DSE) is a security feature in Windows that ensures only signed drivers can be loaded.)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SIP<|>EVENT<|>System Integrity Protection (SIP) is a security feature in macOS that restricts the root user from performing certain actions to protect system integrity.)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MICROSOFT<|>WINDOWS<|>Microsoft is the developer of the Windows operating system, which includes security features like Driver Signature Enforcement (DSE).<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>APPLE<|>MACOS<|>Apple is the developer of the macOS operating system, which includes security features like System Integrity Protection (SIP).<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FIREEYE<|>HIKIT ROOTKIT<|>FireEye has reported on the HIKIT Rootkit, a security threat.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>F-SECURE<|>BLACKENERGY<|>F-Secure has reported on BlackEnergy, a security threat.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>UNIT42<|>ACIDBOX<|>Unit42 has reported on AcidBox, a security threat.<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GITHUB<|>TURLA DRIVER LOADER<|>GitHub hosts the repository for the Turla Driver Loader.<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
