SSL/TLS certificates are designed to instill trust. They include information about the key, information about its owner's identity, and the digital signature of an entity that has verified the certificate's contents are correct. If the signature is valid, and the person examining the certificate trusts the signer, then they know they can use that key to communicate with its owner.\n\nAdversaries may purchase or steal SSL/TLS certificates to further their operations, such as encrypting C2 traffic (ex: [Asymmetric Cryptography](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1573/002) with [Web Protocols](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1071/001)) or even enabling [Adversary-in-the-Middle](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1557) if the certificate is trusted or otherwise added to the root of trust (i.e. [Install Root Certificate](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1553/004)). The purchase of digital certificates may be done using a front organization or using information stolen from a previously compromised entity that allows the adversary to validate to a certificate provider as that entity. Adversaries may also steal certificate materials directly from a compromised third-party, including from certificate authorities.(Citation: DiginotarCompromise) Adversaries may register or hijack domains that they will later purchase an SSL/TLS certificate for.\n\nCertificate authorities exist that allow adversaries to acquire SSL/TLS certificates, such as domain validation certificates, for free.(Citation: Let's Encrypt FAQ)\n\nAfter obtaining a digital certificate, an adversary may then install that certificate (see [Install Digital Certificate](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1608/003)) on infrastructure under their control.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>SSL/TLS CERTIFICATES<|>EVENT<|>SSL/TLS certificates are designed to instill trust and include information about the key, its owner's identity, and the digital signature of an entity that has verified the certificate's contents are correct)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ADVERSARIES<|>PERSON<|>Adversaries may buy and/or steal SSL/TLS certificates to further their operations, such as encrypting C2 traffic or enabling Adversary-in-the-Middle attacks)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CERTIFICATE AUTHORITIES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Entities that verify the contents of SSL/TLS certificates and can issue them, including domain validation certificates)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DIGITAL CERTIFICATES<|>EVENT<|>Digital certificates are used to verify the identity of entities and can be installed on infrastructure under adversary control)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FRONT ORGANIZATION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>An organization used by adversaries to purchase digital certificates)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LET'S ENCRYPT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A certificate authority that allows adversaries to acquire SSL/TLS certificates for free)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COMPROMISED ENTITY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>An entity from which adversaries may steal information to validate to a certificate provider)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COMPROMISED THIRD-PARTY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A third-party from which adversaries may steal certificate materials)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DIGINOTAR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A certificate authority that was compromised by adversaries)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ADVERSARIES<|>SSL/TLS CERTIFICATES<|>Adversaries may buy and/or steal SSL/TLS certificates to further their operations<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ADVERSARIES<|>CERTIFICATE AUTHORITIES<|>Adversaries may steal certificate materials directly from a compromised certificate authority<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ADVERSARIES<|>DIGITAL CERTIFICATES<|>Adversaries may purchase or steal digital certificates to further their operations<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ADVERSARIES<|>FRONT ORGANIZATION<|>Adversaries may use a front organization to purchase digital certificates<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ADVERSARIES<|>COMPROMISED ENTITY<|>Adversaries may use information stolen from a compromised entity to validate to a certificate provider<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ADVERSARIES<|>COMPROMISED THIRD-PARTY<|>Adversaries may steal certificate materials directly from a compromised third-party<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ADVERSARIES<|>LET'S ENCRYPT<|>Adversaries may acquire SSL/TLS certificates for free from Let's Encrypt<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DIGINOTAR<|>CERTIFICATE AUTHORITIES<|>Diginotar is a certificate authority that was compromised by adversaries<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
