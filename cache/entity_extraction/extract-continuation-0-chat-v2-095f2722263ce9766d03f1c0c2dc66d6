Adversaries can take advantage of paths that lack surrounding quotations by placing an executable in a higher level directory within the path, so that Windows will choose the adversary's executable to launch.\n\nService paths (Citation: Microsoft CurrentControlSet Services) and shortcut paths may also be vulnerable to path interception if the path has one or more spaces and is not surrounded by quotation marks (e.g., <code>C:\\unsafe path with space\\program.exe</code> vs. <code>\"C:\\safe path with space\\program.exe\"</code>). (Citation: Help eliminate unquoted path) (stored in Windows Registry keys) An adversary can place an executable in a higher level directory of the path, and Windows will resolve that executable instead of the intended executable. For example, if the path in a shortcut is <code>C:\\program files\\myapp.exe</code>, an adversary may create a program at <code>C:\\program.exe</code> that will be run instead of the intended program. (Citation: Windows Unquoted Services) (Citation: Windows Privilege Escalation Guide)\n\nThis technique can be used for persistence if executables are called on a regular basis, as well as privilege escalation if intercepted executables are started by a higher privileged process.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>MICROSOFT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Microsoft is a technology company that provides the Windows operating system, which is mentioned in the context of vulnerable file path references and service paths)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WINDOWS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Windows is an operating system developed by Microsoft, which is susceptible to path interception vulnerabilities)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WINDOWS REGISTRY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Windows Registry is a database that stores low-level settings for the Windows operating system and for applications that opt to use the registry)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WINDOWS PRIVILEGE ESCALATION GUIDE<|>DOCUMENT<|>A guide that provides information on how to escalate privileges in the Windows operating system)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HELP ELIMINATE UNQUOTED PATH<|>DOCUMENT<|>A document that provides guidance on eliminating unquoted path vulnerabilities in Windows)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WINDOWS UNQUOTED SERVICES<|>DOCUMENT<|>A document that discusses the vulnerabilities associated with unquoted service paths in Windows)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CURRENTCONTROLSET SERVICES<|>DOCUMENT<|>A section in the Windows Registry that stores information about services and their configurations)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MICROSOFT<|>WINDOWS<|>Microsoft is the developer of the Windows operating system<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WINDOWS<|>WINDOWS REGISTRY<|>The Windows Registry is a component of the Windows operating system<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WINDOWS<|>WINDOWS PRIVILEGE ESCALATION GUIDE<|>The Windows Privilege Escalation Guide provides information on how to escalate privileges within the Windows operating system<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WINDOWS<|>HELP ELIMINATE UNQUOTED PATH<|>The Help Eliminate Unquoted Path document provides guidance on addressing unquoted path vulnerabilities in Windows<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WINDOWS<|>WINDOWS UNQUOTED SERVICES<|>The Windows Unquoted Services document discusses vulnerabilities related to unquoted service paths in Windows<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WINDOWS<|>CURRENTCONTROLSET SERVICES<|>The CurrentControlSet Services section in the Windows Registry stores information about services and their configurations<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
