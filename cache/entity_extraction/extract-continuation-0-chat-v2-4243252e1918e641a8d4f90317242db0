In Windows, when files are downloaded from the Internet, they are tagged with a hidden NTFS Alternate Data Stream (ADS) named <code>Zone.Identifier</code> with a specific value known as the MOTW.(Citation: Microsoft Zone.Identifier 2020) Files that are tagged with MOTW are protected and cannot perform certain actions. For example, starting in MS Office 10, if a MS Office file has the MOTW, it will open in Protected View. Executables tagged with the MOTW will be processed by Windows Defender SmartScreen that compares files with an allowlist of well-known executables. If the file is not known/trusted, SmartScreen will prevent the execution and warn the user not to run it.(Citation: Beek Use of VHD Dec 2020)(Citation: Outflank MotW 2020)(Citation: Intezer Russian APT Dec 2020)\n\nAdversaries may abuse container files such as compressed/archive (.arj, .gzip) and/or disk image (.iso, .vhd) file formats to deliver malicious payloads that may not be tagged with MOTW. Container files downloaded from the Internet will be marked with MOTW but the files within may not inherit the MOTW after the container files are extracted and/or mounted. MOTW is a NTFS feature and many container files do not support NTFS alternative data streams. After a container file is extracted and/or mounted, the files contained within them may be treated as local files on disk and run without protections.(Citation: Beek Use of VHD Dec 2020)(Citation: Outflank MotW 2020)\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>MARK-OF-THE-WEB (MOTW)<|>EVENT<|>Mark-of-the-Web (MOTW) is a security feature in Windows that tags files downloaded from the Internet with a hidden NTFS Alternate Data Stream named Zone.Identifier to prevent certain actions and protect the system)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WINDOWS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Windows is an operating system developed by Microsoft that includes security features like Mark-of-the-Web (MOTW) to protect users from potentially harmful files downloaded from the Internet)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NTFS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>NTFS (New Technology File System) is a file system developed by Microsoft that supports features like Alternate Data Streams, which are used in the Mark-of-the-Web (MOTW) security feature)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MS OFFICE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>MS Office is a suite of productivity applications developed by Microsoft, which includes security features like Protected View for files tagged with Mark-of-the-Web (MOTW))\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WINDOWS DEFENDER SMARTSCREEN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Windows Defender SmartScreen is a security feature in Windows that checks executables tagged with Mark-of-the-Web (MOTW) against an allowlist of well-known executables to prevent the execution of untrusted files)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MICROSOFT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Microsoft is a technology company that develops Windows, NTFS, MS Office, and Windows Defender SmartScreen, all of which include features related to Mark-of-the-Web (MOTW))\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VHD<|>ORGANIZATION<|>VHD (Virtual Hard Disk) is a file format used for disk image files that can be mounted and may be used by adversaries to deliver malicious payloads that bypass Mark-of-the-Web (MOTW) protections)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RUSSIAN APT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Russian APT (Advanced Persistent Threat) groups are known to exploit vulnerabilities and security features like Mark-of-the-Web (MOTW) to deliver malicious payloads)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BEEK<|>PERSON<|>Beek is an individual or entity cited in the document for their work on the use of VHD files to bypass Mark-of-the-Web (MOTW) protections)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OUTFLANK<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Outflank is an organization cited in the document for their research on Mark-of-the-Web (MOTW) and its exploitation)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INTEZER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Intezer is a cybersecurity company cited in the document for their research on Russian APT groups and their use of Mark-of-the-Web (MOTW) bypass techniques)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MARK-OF-THE-WEB (MOTW)<|>WINDOWS<|>Mark-of-the-Web (MOTW) is a security feature implemented in the Windows operating system<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MARK-OF-THE-WEB (MOTW)<|>NTFS<|>Mark-of-the-Web (MOTW) uses NTFS Alternate Data Streams to tag files downloaded from the Internet<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MARK-OF-THE-WEB (MOTW)<|>MS OFFICE<|>MS Office files tagged with Mark-of-the-Web (MOTW) open in Protected View<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MARK-OF-THE-WEB (MOTW)<|>WINDOWS DEFENDER SMARTSCREEN<|>Windows Defender SmartScreen processes executables tagged with Mark-of-the-Web (MOTW) to prevent the execution of untrusted files<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WINDOWS<|>MICROSOFT<|>Windows is an operating system developed by Microsoft<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NTFS<|>MICROSOFT<|>NTFS is a file system developed by Microsoft<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MS OFFICE<|>MICROSOFT<|>MS Office is a suite of productivity applications developed by Microsoft<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WINDOWS DEFENDER SMARTSCREEN<|>MICROSOFT<|>Windows Defender SmartScreen is a security feature developed by Microsoft<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>VHD<|>MARK-OF-THE-WEB (MOTW)<|>VHD files may be used to bypass Mark-of-the-Web (MOTW) protections<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RUSSIAN APT<|>MARK-OF-THE-WEB (MOTW)<|>Russian APT groups exploit Mark-of-the-Web (MOTW) to deliver malicious payloads<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BEEK<|>VHD<|>Beek is cited for their work on the use of VHD files to bypass Mark-of-the-Web (MOTW) protections<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>OUTFLANK<|>MARK-OF-THE-WEB (MOTW)<|>Outflank is cited for their research on Mark-of-the-Web (MOTW) and its exploitation<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>INTEZER<|>RUSSIAN APT<|>Intezer is cited for their research on Russian APT groups<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
