Secure Shell (SSH) is a standard means of remote access on Linux and macOS systems. It allows a user to connect to another system via an encrypted tunnel, commonly authenticating through a password, certificate or the use of an asymmetric encryption key pair.\n\nIn order to move laterally from a compromised host, adversaries may take advantage of trust relationships established with other systems via public key authentication in active SSH sessions by hijacking an existing connection to another system. This may occur through compromising the SSH agent itself or by having access to the agent's socket. If an adversary is able to obtain root access, then hijacking SSH sessions is likely trivial.(Citation: Slideshare Abusing SSH)(Citation: SSHjack Blackhat)(Citation: Clockwork SSH Agent Hijacking)(Citation: Breach Post-mortem SSH Hijack)\n\n[SSH Hijacking](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1563/001) differs from use of [SSH](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1021/004) because it hijacks an existing SSH session rather than creating a new session using [Valid Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078).\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>SSH<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Secure Shell (SSH) is a standard means of remote access on Linux and macOS systems, allowing users to connect to another system via an encrypted tunnel, commonly authenticating through a password, certificate, or asymmetric encryption key pair)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SSH HIJACKING<|>EVENT<|>SSH Hijacking is a technique where adversaries hijack an existing SSH session to move laterally within an environment, taking advantage of trust relationships established with other systems via public key authentication)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SLIDESHARE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Slideshare is a platform cited in the context of abusing SSH)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BLACKHAT<|>EVENT<|>Blackhat is a conference where SSHjack was discussed)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CLOCKWORK<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Clockwork is cited in the context of SSH Agent Hijacking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BREACH POST-MORTEM<|>EVENT<|>Breach Post-mortem is an event where SSH Hijack was discussed)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SSH<|>SSH HIJACKING<|>SSH Hijacking involves hijacking an existing SSH session rather than creating a new one<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SLIDESHARE<|>SSH HIJACKING<|>Slideshare is cited in the context of SSH Hijacking<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BLACKHAT<|>SSH HIJACKING<|>Blackhat is a conference where SSHjack, related to SSH Hijacking, was discussed<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CLOCKWORK<|>SSH HIJACKING<|>Clockwork is cited in the context of SSH Agent Hijacking<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BREACH POST-MORTEM<|>SSH HIJACKING<|>Breach Post-mortem is an event where SSH Hijack was discussed<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
