Proc memory injection is a method of executing arbitrary code in the address space of a separate live process. \n\nProc memory injection involves enumerating the memory of a process via the /proc filesystem (<code>/proc/[pid]</code>) then crafting a return-oriented programming (ROP) payload with available gadgets/instructions. Each running process has its own directory, which includes memory mappings. Proc memory injection is commonly performed by overwriting the target processes’ stack using memory mappings provided by the /proc filesystem. This information can be used to enumerate offsets (including the stack) and gadgets (or instructions within the program that can be used to build a malicious payload) otherwise hidden by process memory protections such as address space layout randomization (ASLR). Once enumerated, the target processes’ memory map within <code>/proc/[pid]/maps</code> can be overwritten using dd.(Citation: Uninformed Needle)(Citation: GDS Linux Injection)(Citation: DD Man) \n\nOther techniques such as [Dynamic Linker Hijacking](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/006) may be used to populate a target process with more available gadgets. Similar to [Process Hollowing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1055/012), proc memory injection may target child processes (such as a backgrounded copy of sleep).(Citation: GDS Linux Injection) \n\nRunning code in the context of another process may allow access to the process's memory, system/network resources, and possibly elevated privileges. Execution via proc memory injection may also evade detection from security products since the execution is masked under a legitimate process.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>/PROC FILESYSTEM<|>ORGANIZATION<|>/proc filesystem is a special filesystem in Unix-like operating systems that presents information about processes and other system information in a hierarchical file-like structure)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PROC MEMORY INJECTION<|>EVENT<|>Proc memory injection is a method of executing arbitrary code in the address space of a separate live process by using the /proc filesystem)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RETURN-ORIENTED PROGRAMMING (ROP)<|>EVENT<|>Return-oriented programming (ROP) is a computer security exploit technique that allows an attacker to execute code in the context of another process by using existing code sequences)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ADDRESS SPACE LAYOUT RANDOMIZATION (ASLR)<|>EVENT<|>Address space layout randomization (ASLR) is a security technique used to prevent exploitation of memory corruption vulnerabilities by randomizing the memory addresses used by system and application processes)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DYNAMIC LINKER HIJACKING<|>EVENT<|>Dynamic Linker Hijacking is a technique where an attacker manipulates the dynamic linker/loader to load malicious code into a target process)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PROCESS HOLLOWING<|>EVENT<|>Process Hollowing is a technique where an attacker replaces the memory of a legitimate process with malicious code)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GDS LINUX INJECTION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>GDS Linux Injection is a reference source that provides information on Linux memory injection techniques)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DD MAN<|>PERSON<|>DD Man is a reference source that provides information on using the dd command for memory manipulation)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UNINFORMED NEEDLE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Uninformed Needle is a reference source that provides information on memory injection techniques)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>/PROC FILESYSTEM<|>PROC MEMORY INJECTION<|>/proc filesystem is used to perform proc memory injection<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PROC MEMORY INJECTION<|>RETURN-ORIENTED PROGRAMMING (ROP)<|>Proc memory injection involves crafting a return-oriented programming (ROP) payload<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PROC MEMORY INJECTION<|>ADDRESS SPACE LAYOUT RANDOMIZATION (ASLR)<|>Proc memory injection can bypass address space layout randomization (ASLR)<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DYNAMIC LINKER HIJACKING<|>PROC MEMORY INJECTION<|>Dynamic Linker Hijacking can be used to facilitate proc memory injection<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PROCESS HOLLOWING<|>PROC MEMORY INJECTION<|>Proc memory injection is similar to process hollowing<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GDS LINUX INJECTION<|>PROC MEMORY INJECTION<|>GDS Linux Injection provides information on proc memory injection<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DD MAN<|>PROC MEMORY INJECTION<|>DD Man provides information on using the dd command for proc memory injection<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>UNINFORMED NEEDLE<|>PROC MEMORY INJECTION<|>Uninformed Needle provides information on proc memory injection<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
