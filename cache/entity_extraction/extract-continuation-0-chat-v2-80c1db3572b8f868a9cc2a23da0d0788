Adversaries can create accounts that can be used to build a persona to further operations. Persona development consists of the development of public information, presence, history and appropriate affiliations. This development could be applied to social media, website, or other publicly available information that could be referenced and scrutinized for legitimacy over the course of an operation using that persona or identity.(Citation: NEWSCASTER2014)(Citation: BlackHatRobinSage)\n\nFor operations incorporating social engineering, the utilization of an online persona may be important. These personas may be fictitious or impersonate real people. The persona may exist on a single site or across multiple sites (ex: Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, Google, GitHub, Docker Hub, etc.). Establishing a persona may require development of additional documentation to make them seem real. This could include filling out profile information, developing social networks, or incorporating photos.(Citation: NEWSCASTER2014)(Citation: BlackHatRobinSage)\n\nEstablishing accounts can also include the creation of accounts with email providers, which may be directly leveraged for [Phishing for Information](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1598) or [Phishing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566).(Citation: Mandiant APT1) In addition, establishing accounts may allow adversaries to abuse free services, such as registering for trial periods to [Acquire Infrastructure](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1583) for malicious purposes.(Citation: Free Trial PurpleUrchin)\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>NEWSCASTER2014<|>EVENT<|>NEWSCASTER2014 is a cited event related to the development of online personas for adversarial operations)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BLACKHATROBINSAGE<|>EVENT<|>BlackHatRobinSage is a cited event related to the development of online personas for adversarial operations)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MANDIANT APT1<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Mandiant APT1 is an organization cited in relation to the creation of accounts for phishing and other malicious activities)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FREE TRIAL PURPLEURCHIN<|>EVENT<|>Free Trial PurpleUrchin is a cited event related to the abuse of free services for acquiring infrastructure for malicious purposes)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NEWSCASTER2014<|>BLACKHATROBINSAGE<|>Both NEWSCASTER2014 and BlackHatRobinSage are cited events related to the development of online personas for adversarial operations<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MANDIANT APT1<|>PHISHING<|>Mandiant APT1 is cited in relation to the creation of accounts for phishing activities<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FREE TRIAL PURPLEURCHIN<|>ACQUIRE INFRASTRUCTURE<|>Free Trial PurpleUrchin is cited in relation to the abuse of free services for acquiring infrastructure for malicious purposes<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
