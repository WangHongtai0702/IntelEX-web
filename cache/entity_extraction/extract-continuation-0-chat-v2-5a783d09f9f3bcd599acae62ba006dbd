They may do this, for example, by retrieving account usernames or by using [OS Credential Dumping](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1003). The information may be collected in a number of different ways using other Discovery techniques, because user and username details are prevalent throughout a system and include running process ownership, file/directory ownership, session information, and system logs. Adversaries may use the information from [System Owner/User Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1033) during automated discovery to shape follow-on behaviors, including whether or not the adversary fully infects the target and/or attempts specific actions.\n\nVarious utilities and commands may acquire this information, including <code>whoami</code>. In macOS and Linux, the currently logged in user can be identified with <code>w</code> and <code>who</code>. On macOS the <code>dscl . list /Users | grep -v '_'</code> command can also be used to enumerate user accounts. Environment variables, such as <code>%USERNAME%</code> and <code>$USER</code>, may also be used to access this information.\n\nOn network devices, [Network Device CLI](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/008) commands such as `show users` and `show ssh` can be used to display users currently logged into the device.(Citation: show_ssh_users_cmd_cisco)(Citation: US-CERT TA18-106A Network Infrastructure Devices 2018)\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>OS CREDENTIAL DUMPING<|>EVENT<|>OS Credential Dumping is a technique used by adversaries to retrieve account usernames and other credential information from a system)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SYSTEM OWNER/USER DISCOVERY<|>EVENT<|>System Owner/User Discovery is a technique used by adversaries to identify the primary user, currently logged in user, or set of users that commonly use a system)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NETWORK DEVICE CLI<|>EVENT<|>Network Device CLI commands are used to display users currently logged into a network device)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>US-CERT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>US-CERT is an organization that provides cybersecurity information and alerts)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TA18-106A<|>EVENT<|>TA18-106A is a cybersecurity alert issued by US-CERT regarding network infrastructure devices)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>OS CREDENTIAL DUMPING<|>SYSTEM OWNER/USER DISCOVERY<|>OS Credential Dumping can be used to retrieve account usernames, which is part of the information gathered in System Owner/User Discovery<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NETWORK DEVICE CLI<|>SYSTEM OWNER/USER DISCOVERY<|>Network Device CLI commands can be used to identify users currently logged into a network device, which is part of System Owner/User Discovery<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>US-CERT<|>TA18-106A<|>US-CERT issued the TA18-106A alert<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
