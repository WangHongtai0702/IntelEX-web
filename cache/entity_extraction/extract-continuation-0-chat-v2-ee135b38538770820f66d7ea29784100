JavaScript (JS) is a platform-independent scripting language (compiled just-in-time at runtime) commonly associated with scripts in webpages, though JS can be executed in runtime environments outside the browser.(Citation: NodeJS)\n\nJScript is the Microsoft implementation of the same scripting standard. JScript is interpreted via the Windows Script engine and thus integrated with many components of Windows such as the [Component Object Model](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1559/001) and Internet Explorer HTML Application (HTA) pages.(Citation: JScrip May 2018)(Citation: Microsoft JScript 2007)(Citation: Microsoft Windows Scripts)\n\nJavaScript for Automation (JXA) is a macOS scripting language based on JavaScript, included as part of Apple’s Open Scripting Architecture (OSA), that was introduced in OSX 10.10. Apple’s OSA provides scripting capabilities to control applications, interface with the operating system, and bridge access into the rest of Apple’s internal APIs. As of OSX 10.10, OSA only supports two languages, JXA and [AppleScript](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/002). Scripts can be executed via the command line utility <code>osascript</code>, they can be compiled into applications or script files via <code>osacompile</code>, and they can be compiled and executed in memory of other programs by leveraging the OSAKit Framework.(Citation: Apple About Mac Scripting 2016)(Citation: SpecterOps JXA 2020)(Citation: SentinelOne macOS Red Team)(Citation: Red Canary Silver Sparrow Feb2021)(Citation: MDSec macOS JXA and VSCode)\n\nAdversaries may abuse various implementations of JavaScript to execute various behaviors. Common uses include hosting malicious scripts on websites as part of a [Drive-by Compromise](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1189) or downloading and executing these script files as secondary payloads. Since these payloads are text-based, it is also very common for adversaries to obfuscate their content as part of [Obfuscated Files or Information](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1027).\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>JAVASCRIPT<|>EVENT<|>JavaScript (JS) is a platform-independent scripting language commonly associated with scripts in webpages, though it can be executed in runtime environments outside the browser)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NODEJS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>NodeJS is a runtime environment that allows the execution of JavaScript outside the browser)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JSCRIPT<|>EVENT<|>JScript is the Microsoft implementation of the JavaScript scripting standard, interpreted via the Windows Script engine and integrated with many components of Windows)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WINDOWS<|>GEO<|>Windows is an operating system developed by Microsoft, which integrates JScript with many of its components)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INTERNET EXPLORER HTML APPLICATION (HTA) PAGES<|>EVENT<|>Internet Explorer HTML Application (HTA) pages are a type of web page that can execute JScript)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JXA<|>EVENT<|>JavaScript for Automation (JXA) is a macOS scripting language based on JavaScript, included as part of Apple’s Open Scripting Architecture (OSA))\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>APPLE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Apple is a technology company that developed macOS and its Open Scripting Architecture (OSA))\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OSX 10.10<|>EVENT<|>OSX 10.10 is a version of Apple's macOS that introduced JavaScript for Automation (JXA))\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OSA<|>EVENT<|>Apple’s Open Scripting Architecture (OSA) provides scripting capabilities to control applications, interface with the operating system, and bridge access into the rest of Apple’s internal APIs)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OSASCRIPT<|>EVENT<|>The command line utility <code>osascript</code> is used to execute scripts in macOS)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OSACOMPILE<|>EVENT<|>The command line utility <code>osacompile</code> is used to compile scripts into applications or script files in macOS)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OSAKIT FRAMEWORK<|>EVENT<|>The OSAKit Framework allows scripts to be compiled and executed in memory of other programs in macOS)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DRIVE-BY COMPROMISE<|>EVENT<|>Drive-by Compromise is a technique where malicious scripts are hosted on websites to execute behaviors when visited by users)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OBFUSCATED FILES OR INFORMATION<|>EVENT<|>Obfuscated Files or Information is a technique where adversaries obfuscate the content of their payloads to avoid detection)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JAVASCRIPT<|>NODEJS<|>NodeJS allows the execution of JavaScript outside the browser<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JSCRIPT<|>WINDOWS<|>JScript is integrated with many components of Windows<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JSCRIPT<|>INTERNET EXPLORER HTML APPLICATION (HTA) PAGES<|>JScript can be executed in Internet Explorer HTML Application (HTA) pages<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JXA<|>APPLE<|>JavaScript for Automation (JXA) is a macOS scripting language developed by Apple<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JXA<|>OSX 10.10<|>JavaScript for Automation (JXA) was introduced in OSX 10.10<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>OSA<|>APPLE<|>Apple’s Open Scripting Architecture (OSA) is part of macOS<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>OSASCRIPT<|>OSA<|>The command line utility <code>osascript</code> is part of Apple’s Open Scripting Architecture (OSA)<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>OSACOMPILE<|>OSA<|>The command line utility <code>osacompile</code> is part of Apple’s Open Scripting Architecture (OSA)<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>OSAKIT FRAMEWORK<|>OSA<|>The OSAKit Framework is part of Apple’s Open Scripting Architecture (OSA)<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DRIVE-BY COMPROMISE<|>JAVASCRIPT<|>JavaScript can be used in Drive-by Compromise attacks<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>OBFUSCATED FILES OR INFORMATION<|>JAVASCRIPT<|>JavaScript payloads are often obfuscated as part of Obfuscated Files or Information techniques<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
