The weakness in the system can be a software bug, a temporary glitch, or a misconfiguration.\n\nExploited applications are often websites/web servers, but can also include databases (like SQL), standard services (like SMB or SSH), network device administration and management protocols (like SNMP and Smart Install), and any other system with Internet accessible open sockets.(Citation: NVD CVE-2016-6662)(Citation: CIS Multiple SMB Vulnerabilities)(Citation: US-CERT TA18-106A Network Infrastructure Devices 2018)(Citation: Cisco Blog Legacy Device Attacks)(Citation: NVD CVE-2014-7169) Depending on the flaw being exploited this may also involve [Exploitation for Defense Evasion](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1211) or [Exploitation for Client Execution](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1203).\n\nIf an application is hosted on cloud-based infrastructure and/or is containerized, then exploiting it may lead to compromise of the underlying instance or container. This can allow an adversary a path to access the cloud or container APIs, exploit container host access via [Escape to Host](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1611), or take advantage of weak identity and access management policies.\n\nAdversaries may also exploit edge network infrastructure and related appliances, specifically targeting devices that do not support robust host-based defenses.(Citation: Mandiant Fortinet Zero Day)(Citation: Wired Russia Cyberwar)\n\nFor websites and databases, the OWASP top 10 and CWE top 25 highlight the most common web-based vulnerabilities.(Citation: OWASP Top 10)(Citation: CWE top 25)\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>NVD CVE-2016-6662<|>EVENT<|>A specific vulnerability identified in the National Vulnerability Database, related to SQL databases)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CIS MULTIPLE SMB VULNERABILITIES<|>EVENT<|>A collection of vulnerabilities related to the Server Message Block (SMB) protocol, identified by the Center for Internet Security)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>US-CERT TA18-106A NETWORK INFRASTRUCTURE DEVICES 2018<|>EVENT<|>A technical alert issued by the United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team in 2018, focusing on vulnerabilities in network infrastructure devices)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CISCO BLOG LEGACY DEVICE ATTACKS<|>EVENT<|>A blog post by Cisco discussing attacks on legacy network devices)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NVD CVE-2014-7169<|>EVENT<|>A specific vulnerability identified in the National Vulnerability Database, related to Bash)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MANDIANT FORTINET ZERO DAY<|>EVENT<|>A zero-day vulnerability in Fortinet devices identified by Mandiant)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WIRED RUSSIA CYBERWAR<|>EVENT<|>An article by Wired discussing cyberwarfare activities attributed to Russia)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OWASP TOP 10<|>EVENT<|>A list of the top 10 most critical web application security risks, published by the Open Web Application Security Project)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CWE TOP 25<|>EVENT<|>A list of the top 25 most dangerous software weaknesses, published by the Common Weakness Enumeration)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NVD CVE-2016-6662<|>SQL<|>NVD CVE-2016-6662 is a vulnerability related to SQL databases<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CIS MULTIPLE SMB VULNERABILITIES<|>SMB<|>CIS Multiple SMB Vulnerabilities are related to the Server Message Block (SMB) protocol<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>US-CERT TA18-106A NETWORK INFRASTRUCTURE DEVICES 2018<|>NETWORK INFRASTRUCTURE DEVICES<|>US-CERT TA18-106A focuses on vulnerabilities in network infrastructure devices<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CISCO BLOG LEGACY DEVICE ATTACKS<|>LEGACY DEVICES<|>Cisco Blog Legacy Device Attacks discusses attacks on legacy network devices<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NVD CVE-2014-7169<|>BASH<|>NVD CVE-2014-7169 is a vulnerability related to Bash<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MANDIANT FORTINET ZERO DAY<|>FORTINET<|>Mandiant Fortinet Zero Day is a zero-day vulnerability in Fortinet devices<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WIRED RUSSIA CYBERWAR<|>RUSSIA<|>Wired Russia Cyberwar discusses cyberwarfare activities attributed to Russia<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>OWASP TOP 10<|>WEB APPLICATIONS<|>OWASP Top 10 highlights the most critical web application security risks<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CWE TOP 25<|>SOFTWARE WEAKNESSES<|>CWE Top 25 lists the most dangerous software weaknesses<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
