In some cases, windows that would typically be displayed when an application carries out an operation can be hidden. This may be utilized by system administrators to avoid disrupting user work environments when carrying out administrative tasks. \n\nAdversaries may abuse these functionalities to hide otherwise visible windows from users so as not to alert the user to adversary activity on the system.(Citation: Antiquated Mac Malware)\n\nOn macOS, the configurations for how applications run are listed in property list (plist) files. One of the tags in these files can be <code>apple.awt.UIElement</code>, which allows for Java applications to prevent the application's icon from appearing in the Dock. A common use for this is when applications run in the system tray, but don't also want to show up in the Dock.\n\nSimilarly, on Windows there are a variety of features in scripting languages, such as [PowerShell](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/001), Jscript, and [Visual Basic](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/005) to make windows hidden. One example of this is <code>powershell.exe -WindowStyle Hidden</code>.(Citation: PowerShell About 2019)\n\nIn addition, Windows supports the `CreateDesktop()` API that can create a hidden desktop window with its own corresponding <code>explorer.exe</code> process.(Citation: Hidden VNC)(Citation: Anatomy of an hVNC Attack)  All applications running on the hidden desktop window, such as a hidden VNC (hVNC) session,(Citation: Hidden VNC) will be invisible to other desktops windows.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>MACOS<|>GEO<|>macOS is an operating system developed by Apple Inc. for its Mac computers)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WINDOWS<|>GEO<|>Windows is a group of several proprietary graphical operating system families developed by Microsoft)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>POWERSHELL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>PowerShell is a task automation and configuration management framework from Microsoft, consisting of a command-line shell and the associated scripting language)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JSCRIPT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>JScript is Microsoft's dialect of the ECMAScript standard that is used in Microsoft's Internet Explorer)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VISUAL BASIC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Visual Basic is a third-generation event-driven programming language from Microsoft known for its Component Object Model (COM) programming model)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>APPLE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Apple Inc. is an American multinational technology company that designs, manufactures, and markets consumer electronics, software, and online services)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MICROSOFT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Microsoft Corporation is an American multinational technology company that produces computer software, consumer electronics, personal computers, and related services)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HIDDEN VNC<|>EVENT<|>Hidden VNC (hVNC) is a technique used to create a hidden desktop window with its own corresponding explorer.exe process, making it invisible to other desktop windows)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MACOS<|>APPLE<|>macOS is an operating system developed by Apple Inc.<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WINDOWS<|>MICROSOFT<|>Windows is a group of operating systems developed by Microsoft<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>POWERSHELL<|>MICROSOFT<|>PowerShell is a task automation and configuration management framework from Microsoft<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JSCRIPT<|>MICROSOFT<|>JScript is Microsoft's dialect of the ECMAScript standard<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>VISUAL BASIC<|>MICROSOFT<|>Visual Basic is a programming language developed by Microsoft<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HIDDEN VNC<|>WINDOWS<|>Hidden VNC is a technique that can be used on Windows to create a hidden desktop window<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
