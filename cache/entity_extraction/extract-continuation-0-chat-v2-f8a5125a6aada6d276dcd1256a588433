AppleScript is a macOS scripting language designed to control applications and parts of the OS via inter-application messages called AppleEvents.(Citation: Apple AppleScript) These AppleEvent messages can be sent independently or easily scripted with AppleScript. These events can locate open windows, send keystrokes, and interact with almost any open application locally or remotely.\n\nScripts can be run from the command-line via <code>osascript /path/to/script</code> or <code>osascript -e \"script here\"</code>. Aside from the command line, scripts can be executed in numerous ways including Mail rules, Calendar.app alarms, and Automator workflows. AppleScripts can also be executed as plain text shell scripts by adding <code>#!/usr/bin/osascript</code> to the start of the script file.(Citation: SentinelOne AppleScript)\n\nAppleScripts do not need to call <code>osascript</code> to execute. However, they may be executed from within mach-O binaries by using the macOS [Native API](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1106)s <code>NSAppleScript</code> or <code>OSAScript</code>, both of which execute code independent of the <code>/usr/bin/osascript</code> command line utility.\n\nAdversaries may abuse AppleScript to execute various behaviors, such as interacting with an open SSH connection, moving to remote machines, and even presenting users with fake dialog boxes. These events cannot start applications remotely (they can start them locally), but they can interact with applications if they're already running remotely. On macOS 10.10 Yosemite and higher, AppleScript has the ability to execute [Native API](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1106)s, which otherwise would require compilation and execution in a mach-O binary file format.(Citation: SentinelOne macOS Red Team) Since this is a scripting language, it can be used to launch more common techniques as well such as a reverse shell via [Python](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/006).(Citation: Macro Malware Targets Macs)\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>APPLESCRIPT<|>EVENT<|>AppleScript is a macOS scripting language designed to control applications and parts of the OS via inter-application messages called AppleEvents)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>APPLE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Apple is the company that developed AppleScript and macOS)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SENTINELONE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>SentinelOne is a cybersecurity company that has published information on the use of AppleScript in macOS)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MACOS<|>GEO<|>macOS is the operating system developed by Apple for its line of computers)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NATIVE API<|>EVENT<|>Native API refers to the macOS APIs such as NSAppleScript and OSAScript that can execute AppleScript code)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PYTHON<|>EVENT<|>Python is a programming language that can be used to launch techniques such as a reverse shell)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>APPLESCRIPT<|>APPLE<|>AppleScript is a scripting language developed by Apple<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>APPLESCRIPT<|>SENTINELONE<|>SentinelOne has published information on the use of AppleScript<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>APPLESCRIPT<|>MACOS<|>AppleScript is a scripting language used in macOS<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>APPLESCRIPT<|>NATIVE API<|>AppleScript can execute Native API calls such as NSAppleScript and OSAScript<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>APPLESCRIPT<|>PYTHON<|>AppleScript can be used to launch techniques such as a reverse shell via Python<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
