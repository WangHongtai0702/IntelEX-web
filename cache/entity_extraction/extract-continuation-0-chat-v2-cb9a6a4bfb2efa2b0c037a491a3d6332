Mach-O binaries have a series of headers that are used to perform certain operations when a binary is loaded. The LC_LOAD_DYLIB header in a Mach-O binary tells macOS and OS X which dynamic libraries (dylibs) to load during execution time. These can be added ad-hoc to the compiled binary as long as adjustments are made to the rest of the fields and dependencies.(Citation: Writing Bad Malware for OSX) There are tools available to perform these changes.\n\nAdversaries may modify Mach-O binary headers to load and execute malicious dylibs every time the binary is executed. Although any changes will invalidate digital signatures on binaries because the binary is being modified, this can be remediated by simply removing the LC_CODE_SIGNATURE command from the binary so that the signature isnâ€™t checked at load time.(Citation: Malware Persistence on OS X)\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>MACH-O BINARY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Mach-O binary is a type of executable file format used in macOS and OS X that contains a series of headers to perform certain operations when loaded)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LC_LOAD_DYLIB<|>ORGANIZATION<|>LC_LOAD_DYLIB is a header in a Mach-O binary that tells macOS and OS X which dynamic libraries (dylibs) to load during execution time)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LC_CODE_SIGNATURE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>LC_CODE_SIGNATURE is a command in a Mach-O binary that ensures the digital signature of the binary is checked at load time)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OSX<|>GEO<|>OSX is an operating system developed by Apple Inc. for Mac computers)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MACOS<|>GEO<|>macOS is the current operating system developed by Apple Inc. for Mac computers, succeeding OSX)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WRITING BAD MALWARE FOR OSX<|>EVENT<|>Writing Bad Malware for OSX is a cited source that discusses the process of modifying Mach-O binaries to execute malicious content)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MALWARE PERSISTENCE ON OS X<|>EVENT<|>Malware Persistence on OS X is a cited source that discusses methods for maintaining persistence of malware on OS X systems)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MACH-O BINARY<|>LC_LOAD_DYLIB<|>LC_LOAD_DYLIB is a header in a Mach-O binary that specifies which dynamic libraries to load<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MACH-O BINARY<|>LC_CODE_SIGNATURE<|>LC_CODE_SIGNATURE is a command in a Mach-O binary that ensures the digital signature is checked<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>OSX<|>MACOS<|>macOS is the successor to OSX as the operating system for Mac computers<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WRITING BAD MALWARE FOR OSX<|>MACH-O BINARY<|>Writing Bad Malware for OSX discusses modifying Mach-O binaries to execute malicious content<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MALWARE PERSISTENCE ON OS X<|>MACH-O BINARY<|>Malware Persistence on OS X discusses methods for maintaining malware persistence in Mach-O binaries<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
