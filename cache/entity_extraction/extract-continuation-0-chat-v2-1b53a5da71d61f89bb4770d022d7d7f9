(Citation: Fifield Blocking Resistent Communication through domain fronting 2015) Domain fronting involves using different domain names in the SNI field of the TLS header and the Host field of the HTTP header. If both domains are served from the same CDN, then the CDN may route to the address specified in the HTTP header after unwrapping the TLS header. A variation of the the technique, \"domainless\" fronting, utilizes a SNI field that is left blank; this may allow the fronting to work even when the CDN attempts to validate that the SNI and HTTP Host fields match (if the blank SNI fields are ignored).\n\nFor example, if domain-x and domain-y are customers of the same CDN, it is possible to place domain-x in the TLS header and domain-y in the HTTP header. Traffic will appear to be going to domain-x, however the CDN may route it to domain-y.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CONTENT DELIVERY NETWORKS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) are services that host multiple domains and can be exploited by adversaries to obfuscate the intended destination of HTTPS traffic)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FIFIELD<|>PERSON<|>Fifield is the author of the 2015 paper on Blocking Resistant Communication through domain fronting)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DOMAIN FRONTING<|>EVENT<|>Domain fronting is a technique that involves using different domain names in the SNI field of the TLS header and the Host field of the HTTP header to obfuscate the intended destination of HTTPS traffic)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DOMAINLESS FRONTING<|>EVENT<|>Domainless fronting is a variation of domain fronting that utilizes a blank SNI field to potentially bypass CDN validation checks)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TLS HEADER<|>EVENT<|>The TLS header is part of the Transport Layer Security protocol used to secure communications over a computer network)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HTTP HEADER<|>EVENT<|>The HTTP header is part of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol used to transmit information on the web)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CONTENT DELIVERY NETWORKS<|>DOMAIN FRONTING<|>CDNs can be exploited using domain fronting to obfuscate the intended destination of HTTPS traffic<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CONTENT DELIVERY NETWORKS<|>DOMAINLESS FRONTING<|>CDNs can be exploited using domainless fronting to obfuscate the intended destination of HTTPS traffic<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DOMAIN FRONTING<|>TLS HEADER<|>Domain fronting involves using different domain names in the SNI field of the TLS header<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DOMAIN FRONTING<|>HTTP HEADER<|>Domain fronting involves using different domain names in the Host field of the HTTP header<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DOMAINLESS FRONTING<|>TLS HEADER<|>Domainless fronting involves using a blank SNI field in the TLS header<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FIFIELD<|>DOMAIN FRONTING<|>Fifield authored a paper on Blocking Resistant Communication through domain fronting<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
