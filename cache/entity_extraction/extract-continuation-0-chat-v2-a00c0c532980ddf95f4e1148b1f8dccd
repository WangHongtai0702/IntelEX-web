Occasionally, large numbers of username and password pairs are dumped online when a website or service is compromised and the user account credentials accessed. The information may be useful to an adversary attempting to compromise accounts by taking advantage of the tendency for users to use the same passwords across personal and business accounts.\n\nCredential stuffing is a risky option because it could cause numerous authentication failures and account lockouts, depending on the organization's login failure policies.\n\nTypically, management services over commonly used ports are used when stuffing credentials. Commonly targeted services include the following:\n\n* SSH (22/TCP)\n* Telnet (23/TCP)\n* FTP (21/TCP)\n* NetBIOS / SMB / Samba (139/TCP & 445/TCP)\n* LDAP (389/TCP)\n* Kerberos (88/TCP)\n* RDP / Terminal Services (3389/TCP)\n* HTTP/HTTP Management Services (80/TCP & 443/TCP)\n* MSSQL (1433/TCP)\n* Oracle (1521/TCP)\n* MySQL (3306/TCP)\n* VNC (5900/TCP)\n\nIn addition to management services, adversaries may \"target single sign-on (SSO) and cloud-based applications utilizing federated authentication protocols,\" as well as externally facing email applications, such as Office 365.(Citation: US-CERT TA18-068A 2018)\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>SSH<|>ORGANIZATION<|>SSH (Secure Shell) is a protocol used for secure remote login and other secure network services over an insecure network)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TELNET<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Telnet is an application protocol used on the Internet or local area networks to provide a bidirectional interactive text-oriented communication facility using a virtual terminal connection)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FTP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>FTP (File Transfer Protocol) is a standard network protocol used for the transfer of computer files between a client and server on a computer network)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NETBIOS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>NetBIOS (Network Basic Input/Output System) is a program that allows applications on different computers to communicate within a local area network)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SMB<|>ORGANIZATION<|>SMB (Server Message Block) is a network file sharing protocol that allows applications to read and write to files and request services from server programs in a computer network)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SAMBA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Samba is a free software re-implementation of the SMB networking protocol, and was originally developed by Andrew Tridgell)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LDAP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) is an open, vendor-neutral, industry standard application protocol for accessing and maintaining distributed directory information services over an Internet Protocol network)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KERBEROS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Kerberos is a computer network authentication protocol that works on the basis of tickets to allow nodes communicating over a non-secure network to prove their identity to one another in a secure manner)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RDP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) is a proprietary protocol developed by Microsoft, which provides a user with a graphical interface to connect to another computer over a network connection)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TERMINAL SERVICES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Terminal Services, now known as Remote Desktop Services, is one of the components of Microsoft Windows that allows a user to take control of a remote computer or virtual machine over a network connection)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HTTP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is an application protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MSSQL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>MSSQL (Microsoft SQL Server) is a relational database management system developed by Microsoft)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ORACLE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Oracle Database is a multi-model database management system produced and marketed by Oracle Corporation)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MYSQL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>MySQL is an open-source relational database management system)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VNC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>VNC (Virtual Network Computing) is a graphical desktop-sharing system that uses the Remote Frame Buffer protocol to remotely control another computer)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OFFICE 365<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Office 365 is a line of subscription services offered by Microsoft as part of the Microsoft Office product line)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>US-CERT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>US-CERT (United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team) is an organization within the Department of Homeland Security that provides cybersecurity protection to the federal government and collaborates with the private sector to improve the nation's cybersecurity posture)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TA18-068A<|>EVENT<|>TA18-068A is a technical alert issued by US-CERT in 2018 regarding credential stuffing attacks and their implications)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SSH<|>TELNET<|>Both SSH and Telnet are protocols used for remote login, but SSH is secure while Telnet is not<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NETBIOS<|>SMB<|>NetBIOS and SMB are both protocols used for network communication and file sharing<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SMB<|>SAMBA<|>Samba is a re-implementation of the SMB protocol<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RDP<|>TERMINAL SERVICES<|>RDP is a protocol used by Terminal Services for remote desktop access<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HTTP<|>OFFICE 365<|>Office 365 uses HTTP/HTTPS for web-based access to its services<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>US-CERT<|>TA18-068A<|>TA18-068A is a technical alert issued by US-CERT<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
