Use of MFA is recommended and provides a higher level of security than usernames and passwords alone, but organizations should be aware of techniques that could be used to intercept and bypass these security mechanisms. \n\nIf a smart card is used for multi-factor authentication, then a keylogger will need to be used to obtain the password associated with a smart card during normal use. With both an inserted card and access to the smart card password, an adversary can connect to a network resource using the infected system to proxy the authentication with the inserted hardware token. (Citation: Mandiant M Trends 2011)\n\nAdversaries may also employ a keylogger to similarly target other hardware tokens, such as RSA SecurID. Capturing token input (including a user's personal identification code) may provide temporary access (i.e. replay the one-time passcode until the next value rollover) as well as possibly enabling adversaries to reliably predict future authentication values (given access to both the algorithm and any seed values used to generate appended temporary codes). (Citation: GCN RSA June 2011)\n\nOther methods of MFA may be intercepted and used by an adversary to authenticate. It is common for one-time codes to be sent via out-of-band communications (email, SMS). If the device and/or service is not secured, then it may be vulnerable to interception. Service providers can also be targeted: for example, an adversary may compromise an SMS messaging service in order to steal MFA codes sent to users’ phones.(Citation: Okta Scatter Swine 2022)\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>MULTI-FACTOR AUTHENTICATION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Multi-factor authentication (MFA) mechanisms, such as smart cards and token generators, provide a higher level of security than usernames and passwords alone by requiring multiple forms of verification)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SMART CARD<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A type of hardware token used in multi-factor authentication that requires a password for access)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KEYLOGGER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A malicious tool used to capture keystrokes, including passwords, to gain unauthorized access to systems)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RSA SECURID<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A hardware token used in multi-factor authentication that generates one-time passcodes for secure access)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MANDIANT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A cybersecurity firm that published the M Trends 2011 report, which discusses techniques for intercepting and bypassing MFA mechanisms)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GCN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A publication that reported on RSA SecurID vulnerabilities in June 2011)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OKTA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A company that published the Scatter Swine 2022 report, which discusses the compromise of SMS messaging services to steal MFA codes)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SMS MESSAGING SERVICE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A service that can be targeted by adversaries to intercept MFA codes sent to users' phones)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OUT-OF-BAND COMMUNICATIONS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Methods such as email and SMS used to send one-time codes for multi-factor authentication)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SCATTER SWINE 2022<|>EVENT<|>A report by Okta discussing the compromise of SMS messaging services to steal MFA codes)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>M TRENDS 2011<|>EVENT<|>A report by Mandiant discussing techniques for intercepting and bypassing MFA mechanisms)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RSA JUNE 2011<|>EVENT<|>A report by GCN discussing vulnerabilities in RSA SecurID)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MULTI-FACTOR AUTHENTICATION<|>SMART CARD<|>Smart cards are a type of hardware token used in multi-factor authentication<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MULTI-FACTOR AUTHENTICATION<|>RSA SECURID<|>RSA SecurID is a type of hardware token used in multi-factor authentication<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SMART CARD<|>KEYLOGGER<|>A keylogger can be used to capture the password associated with a smart card<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RSA SECURID<|>KEYLOGGER<|>A keylogger can be used to capture the personal identification code for RSA SecurID<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MULTI-FACTOR AUTHENTICATION<|>OUT-OF-BAND COMMUNICATIONS<|>Out-of-band communications such as email and SMS are used to send one-time codes for multi-factor authentication<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>OUT-OF-BAND COMMUNICATIONS<|>SMS MESSAGING SERVICE<|>SMS messaging services are a type of out-of-band communication used to send MFA codes<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SMS MESSAGING SERVICE<|>OKTA<|>Okta reported on the compromise of SMS messaging services to steal MFA codes in the Scatter Swine 2022 report<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MULTI-FACTOR AUTHENTICATION<|>MANDIANT<|>Mandiant published the M Trends 2011 report discussing techniques for intercepting and bypassing MFA mechanisms<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MULTI-FACTOR AUTHENTICATION<|>GCN<|>GCN reported on RSA SecurID vulnerabilities in June 2011<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MANDIANT<|>M TRENDS 2011<|>Mandiant published the M Trends 2011 report<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GCN<|>RSA JUNE 2011<|>GCN published the RSA June 2011 report<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>OKTA<|>SCATTER SWINE 2022<|>Okta published the Scatter Swine 2022 report<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
