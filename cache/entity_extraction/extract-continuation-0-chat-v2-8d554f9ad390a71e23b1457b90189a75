This activity may be used to enable follow-on behaviors such as [Network Sniffing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1040) or [Transmitted Data Manipulation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1565/002).\n\nThe ARP protocol is used to resolve IPv4 addresses to link layer addresses, such as a media access control (MAC) address.(Citation: RFC826 ARP) Devices in a local network segment communicate with each other by using link layer addresses. If a networked device does not have the link layer address of a particular networked device, it may send out a broadcast ARP request to the local network to translate the IP address to a MAC address. The device with the associated IP address directly replies with its MAC address. The networked device that made the ARP request will then use as well as store that information in its ARP cache.\n\nAn adversary may passively wait for an ARP request to poison the ARP cache of the requesting device. The adversary may reply with their MAC address, thus deceiving the victim by making them believe that they are communicating with the intended networked device. For the adversary to poison the ARP cache, their reply must be faster than the one made by the legitimate IP address owner. Adversaries may also send a gratuitous ARP reply that maliciously announces the ownership of a particular IP address to all the devices in the local network segment.\n\nThe ARP protocol is stateless and does not require authentication. Therefore, devices may wrongly add or update the MAC address of the IP address in their ARP cache.(Citation: Sans ARP Spoofing Aug 2003)(Citation: Cylance Cleaver)\n\nAdversaries may use ARP cache poisoning as a means to intercept network traffic. This activity may be used to collect and/or relay data such as credentials, especially those sent over an insecure, unencrypted protocol.(Citation: Sans ARP Spoofing Aug 2003)\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ADDRESS RESOLUTION PROTOCOL<|>EVENT<|>The Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) is used to resolve IPv4 addresses to link layer addresses, such as a media access control (MAC) address)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ARP CACHE POISONING<|>EVENT<|>ARP cache poisoning is an attack where adversaries position themselves between the communication of two or more networked devices by poisoning ARP caches)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NETWORK SNIFFING<|>EVENT<|>Network sniffing is a follow-on behavior enabled by ARP cache poisoning, where adversaries intercept network traffic to collect data)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TRANSMITTED DATA MANIPULATION<|>EVENT<|>Transmitted data manipulation is another follow-on behavior enabled by ARP cache poisoning, where adversaries manipulate data being transmitted over the network)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RFC826<|>ORGANIZATION<|>RFC826 is a document that specifies the ARP protocol)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SANS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>SANS is an organization that has published information on ARP spoofing)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CYLANCE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Cylance is a cybersecurity company that has published information on ARP cache poisoning)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ADDRESS RESOLUTION PROTOCOL<|>ARP CACHE POISONING<|>ARP cache poisoning exploits the ARP protocol to position adversaries between networked devices<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ARP CACHE POISONING<|>NETWORK SNIFFING<|>ARP cache poisoning can enable network sniffing by intercepting network traffic<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ARP CACHE POISONING<|>TRANSMITTED DATA MANIPULATION<|>ARP cache poisoning can enable transmitted data manipulation by allowing adversaries to manipulate data<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RFC826<|>ADDRESS RESOLUTION PROTOCOL<|>RFC826 specifies the ARP protocol<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SANS<|>ARP CACHE POISONING<|>SANS has published information on ARP cache poisoning<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CYLANCE<|>ARP CACHE POISONING<|>Cylance has published information on ARP cache poisoning<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
