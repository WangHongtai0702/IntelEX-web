Endpoint DoS can be performed by exhausting the system resources those services are hosted on or exploiting the system to cause a persistent crash condition. Example services include websites, email services, DNS, and web-based applications. Adversaries have been observed conducting DoS attacks for political purposes(Citation: FireEye OpPoisonedHandover February 2016) and to support other malicious activities, including distraction(Citation: FSISAC FraudNetDoS September 2012), hacktivism, and extortion.(Citation: Symantec DDoS October 2014)\n\nAn Endpoint DoS denies the availability of a service without saturating the network used to provide access to the service. Adversaries can target various layers of the application stack that is hosted on the system used to provide the service. These layers include the Operating Systems (OS), server applications such as web servers, DNS servers, databases, and the (typically web-based) applications that sit on top of them. Attacking each layer requires different techniques that take advantage of bottlenecks that are unique to the respective components. A DoS attack may be generated by a single system or multiple systems spread across the internet, which is commonly referred to as a distributed DoS (DDoS).\n\nTo perform DoS attacks against endpoint resources, several aspects apply to multiple methods, including IP address spoofing and botnets.\n\nAdversaries may use the original IP address of an attacking system, or spoof the source IP address to make the attack traffic more difficult to trace back to the attacking system or to enable reflection. This can increase the difficulty defenders have in defending against the attack by reducing or eliminating the effectiveness of filtering by the source address on network defense devices.\n\nBotnets are commonly used to conduct DDoS attacks against networks and services. Large botnets can generate a significant amount of traffic from systems spread across the global internet. Adversaries may have the resources to build out and control their own botnet infrastructure or may rent time on an existing botnet to conduct an attack. In some of the worst cases for DDoS, so many systems are used to generate requests that each one only needs to send out a small amount of traffic to produce enough volume to exhaust the target's resources. In such circumstances, distinguishing DDoS traffic from legitimate clients becomes exceedingly difficult. Botnets have been used in some of the most high-profile DDoS attacks, such as the 2012 series of incidents that targeted major US banks.(Citation: USNYAG IranianBotnet March 2016)\n\nIn cases where traffic manipulation is used, there may be points in the global network (such as high traffic gateway routers) where packets can be altered and cause legitimate clients to execute code that directs network packets toward a target in high volume. This type of capability was previously used for the purposes of web censorship where client HTTP traffic was modified to include a reference to JavaScript that generated the DDoS code to overwhelm target web servers.(Citation: ArsTechnica Great Firewall of China)\n\nFor attacks attempting to saturate the providing network, see [Network Denial of Service](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1498).\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>FIREEYE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>FireEye is a cybersecurity firm that observed DoS attacks for political purposes in February 2016)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FSISAC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>FSISAC is an organization that reported on DoS attacks used for distraction in September 2012)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SYMANTEC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Symantec is a cybersecurity company that reported on DDoS attacks in October 2014)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>USNYAG<|>ORGANIZATION<|>USNYAG (United States New York Attorney General) reported on Iranian botnet attacks targeting major US banks in March 2016)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>IRANIAN BOTNET<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A botnet used in a series of high-profile DDoS attacks targeting major US banks in 2012)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GREAT FIREWALL OF CHINA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A censorship tool used to manipulate web traffic and generate DDoS attacks)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DDoS ATTACKS TARGETING MAJOR US BANKS<|>EVENT<|>A series of high-profile DDoS attacks in 2012 targeting major US banks)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WEB CENSORSHIP<|>EVENT<|>The practice of manipulating web traffic to include malicious code, used in DDoS attacks)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ENDPOINT DENIAL OF SERVICE<|>EVENT<|>A type of attack that degrades or blocks the availability of services to users by exhausting system resources or causing persistent crashes)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DISTRIBUTED DENIAL OF SERVICE<|>EVENT<|>A type of DoS attack generated by multiple systems spread across the internet)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FIREEYE<|>ENDPOINT DENIAL OF SERVICE<|>FireEye observed DoS attacks for political purposes<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FSISAC<|>ENDPOINT DENIAL OF SERVICE<|>FSISAC reported on DoS attacks used for distraction<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SYMANTEC<|>ENDPOINT DENIAL OF SERVICE<|>Symantec reported on DDoS attacks<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>USNYAG<|>IRANIAN BOTNET<|>USNYAG reported on the Iranian botnet attacks<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>IRANIAN BOTNET<|>DDoS ATTACKS TARGETING MAJOR US BANKS<|>The Iranian botnet was used in the DDoS attacks targeting major US banks<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GREAT FIREWALL OF CHINA<|>WEB CENSORSHIP<|>The Great Firewall of China was used to manipulate web traffic for censorship<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GREAT FIREWALL OF CHINA<|>ENDPOINT DENIAL OF SERVICE<|>The Great Firewall of China was used to generate DDoS attacks<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
