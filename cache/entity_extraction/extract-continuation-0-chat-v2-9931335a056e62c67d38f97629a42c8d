Alternate authentication material is legitimately generated by systems after a user or application successfully authenticates by providing a valid identity and the required authentication factor(s). Alternate authentication material may also be generated during the identity creation process.(Citation: NIST Authentication)(Citation: NIST MFA)\n\nCaching alternate authentication material allows the system to verify an identity has successfully authenticated without asking the user to reenter authentication factor(s). Because the alternate authentication must be maintained by the system—either in memory or on disk—it may be at risk of being stolen through [Credential Access](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0006) techniques. By stealing alternate authentication material, adversaries are able to bypass system access controls and authenticate to systems without knowing the plaintext password or any additional authentication factors.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## Entities\n(\"entity\"<|>NIST<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is a physical sciences laboratory and non-regulatory agency of the United States Department of Commerce, which provides standards and guidelines for authentication and multi-factor authentication (MFA).)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CREDENTIAL ACCESS<|>EVENT<|>Credential Access is a tactic used by adversaries to steal credentials, such as password hashes, Kerberos tickets, and application access tokens, to bypass system access controls.)\n\n## Relationships\n(\"relationship\"<|>NIST<|>CREDENTIAL ACCESS<|>NIST provides guidelines and standards that can help mitigate the risks associated with Credential Access techniques.<|>7)\n\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
