Debuggers are typically used by defenders to trace and/or analyze the execution of potential malware payloads.(Citation: ProcessHacker Github)\n\nDebugger evasion may include changing behaviors based on the results of the checks for the presence of artifacts indicative of a debugged environment. Similar to [Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1497), if the adversary detects a debugger, they may alter their malware to disengage from the victim or conceal the core functions of the implant. They may also search for debugger artifacts before dropping secondary or additional payloads.\n\nSpecific checks will vary based on the target and/or adversary, but may involve [Native API](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1106) function calls such as <code>IsDebuggerPresent()</code> and <code> NtQueryInformationProcess()</code>, or manually checking the <code>BeingDebugged</code> flag of the Process Environment Block (PEB). Other checks for debugging artifacts may also seek to enumerate hardware breakpoints, interrupt assembly opcodes, time checks, or measurements if exceptions are raised in the current process (assuming a present debugger would “swallow” or handle the potential error).(Citation: hasherezade debug)(Citation: AlKhaser Debug)(Citation: vxunderground debug)\n\nAdversaries may use the information learned from these debugger checks during automated discovery to shape follow-on behaviors. Debuggers can also be evaded by detaching the process or flooding debug logs with meaningless data via messages produced by looping [Native API](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1106) function calls such as <code>OutputDebugStringW()</code>.(Citation: wardle evilquest partii)(Citation: Checkpoint Dridex Jan 2021)\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>PROCESSHACKER GITHUB<|>ORGANIZATION<|>ProcessHacker Github is a repository that provides tools and information related to debugging and process management)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HASHEREZADE<|>PERSON<|>Hasherezade is an individual or entity cited for their work on debugging techniques)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ALKHASER<|>PERSON<|>AlKhaser is an individual or entity cited for their work on debugging techniques)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VXUNDERGROUND<|>ORGANIZATION<|>VxUnderground is an organization or platform cited for their work on debugging techniques)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WARDLE<|>PERSON<|>Wardle is an individual or entity cited for their work on debugging techniques, specifically related to EvilQuest)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHECKPOINT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Checkpoint is an organization cited for their work on Dridex malware in January 2021)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DRIDEX<|>EVENT<|>Dridex is a malware campaign that was analyzed by Checkpoint in January 2021)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EVILQUEST<|>EVENT<|>EvilQuest is a malware campaign that was analyzed by Wardle)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PROCESSHACKER GITHUB<|>HASHEREZADE<|>Hasherezade's work on debugging techniques is cited in the ProcessHacker Github repository<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PROCESSHACKER GITHUB<|>ALKHASER<|>AlKhaser's work on debugging techniques is cited in the ProcessHacker Github repository<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PROCESSHACKER GITHUB<|>VXUNDERGROUND<|>VxUnderground's work on debugging techniques is cited in the ProcessHacker Github repository<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PROCESSHACKER GITHUB<|>WARDLE<|>Wardle's work on debugging techniques, specifically related to EvilQuest, is cited in the ProcessHacker Github repository<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PROCESSHACKER GITHUB<|>CHECKPOINT<|>Checkpoint's work on Dridex malware is cited in the ProcessHacker Github repository<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHECKPOINT<|>DRIDEX<|>Checkpoint analyzed the Dridex malware campaign in January 2021<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WARDLE<|>EVILQUEST<|>Wardle analyzed the EvilQuest malware campaign<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
