This type of Network DoS takes advantage of a third-party server intermediary that hosts and will respond to a given spoofed source IP address. This third-party server is commonly termed a reflector. An adversary accomplishes a reflection attack by sending packets to reflectors with the spoofed address of the victim. Similar to Direct Network Floods, more than one system may be used to conduct the attack, or a botnet may be used. Likewise, one or more reflectors may be used to focus traffic on the target.(Citation: Cloudflare ReflectionDoS May 2017) This Network DoS attack may also reduce the availability and functionality of the targeted system(s) and network.\n\nReflection attacks often take advantage of protocols with larger responses than requests in order to amplify their traffic, commonly known as a Reflection Amplification attack. Adversaries may be able to generate an increase in volume of attack traffic that is several orders of magnitude greater than the requests sent to the amplifiers. The extent of this increase will depending upon many variables, such as the protocol in question, the technique used, and the amplifying servers that actually produce the amplification in attack volume. Two prominent protocols that have enabled Reflection Amplification Floods are DNS(Citation: Cloudflare DNSamplficationDoS) and NTP(Citation: Cloudflare NTPamplifciationDoS), though the use of several others in the wild have been documented.(Citation: Arbor AnnualDoSreport Jan 2018)  In particular, the memcache protocol showed itself to be a powerful protocol, with amplification sizes up to 51,200 times the requesting packet.(Citation: Cloudflare Memcrashed Feb 2018)\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CLOUDFLARE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Cloudflare is a company that provides network services, including protection against various types of denial of service (DoS) attacks)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ARBOR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Arbor is a company that produces annual reports on denial of service (DoS) attacks and other network security issues)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>REFLECTION ATTACK<|>EVENT<|>A type of Network DoS attack where adversaries send packets to reflectors with the spoofed address of the victim to cause a denial of service)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>REFLECTION AMPLIFICATION ATTACK<|>EVENT<|>A type of reflection attack that takes advantage of protocols with larger responses than requests to amplify traffic)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DNS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Domain Name System (DNS) is a protocol that has been used in reflection amplification attacks)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NTP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Network Time Protocol (NTP) is a protocol that has been used in reflection amplification attacks)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MEMCACHE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Memcache is a protocol that has shown to be powerful in reflection amplification attacks, with amplification sizes up to 51,200 times the requesting packet)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CLOUDFLARE<|>REFLECTION ATTACK<|>Cloudflare has documented and reported on reflection attacks<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CLOUDFLARE<|>REFLECTION AMPLIFICATION ATTACK<|>Cloudflare has documented and reported on reflection amplification attacks<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CLOUDFLARE<|>DNS<|>Cloudflare has documented the use of DNS in reflection amplification attacks<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CLOUDFLARE<|>NTP<|>Cloudflare has documented the use of NTP in reflection amplification attacks<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CLOUDFLARE<|>MEMCACHE<|>Cloudflare has documented the use of Memcache in reflection amplification attacks<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ARBOR<|>REFLECTION ATTACK<|>Arbor has documented and reported on reflection attacks<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ARBOR<|>REFLECTION AMPLIFICATION ATTACK<|>Arbor has documented and reported on reflection amplification attacks<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
