This may include things such as cloud monitoring agents and anti-virus. Adversaries may use the information from [Security Software Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1518/001) during automated discovery to shape follow-on behaviors, including whether or not the adversary fully infects the target and/or attempts specific actions.\n\nExample commands that can be used to obtain security software information are [netsh](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0108), <code>reg query</code> with [Reg](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0075), <code>dir</code> with [cmd](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0106), and [Tasklist](https://attack.mitre.org/software/S0057), but other indicators of discovery behavior may be more specific to the type of software or security system the adversary is looking for. It is becoming more common to see macOS malware perform checks for LittleSnitch and KnockKnock software.\n\nAdversaries may also utilize the [Cloud API](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/009) to discover cloud-native security software installed on compute infrastructure, such as the AWS CloudWatch agent, Azure VM Agent, and Google Cloud Monitor agent. These agents  may collect  metrics and logs from the VM, which may be centrally aggregated in a cloud-based monitoring platform.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>SECURITY SOFTWARE DISCOVERY<|>EVENT<|>Security Software Discovery is a technique used by adversaries to identify security software, configurations, defensive tools, and sensors installed on a system or in a cloud environment)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NETSH<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Netsh is a command-line scripting utility that allows you to display or modify the network configuration of a computer that is currently running)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>REG<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Reg is a command-line tool that can be used to query, add, delete, and modify registry keys and values)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CMD<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Cmd is the command-line interpreter for Windows operating systems)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TASKLIST<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Tasklist is a command-line utility that displays a list of currently running processes on a local or remote machine)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LITTLESNITCH<|>ORGANIZATION<|>LittleSnitch is a macOS application that monitors and controls outbound network traffic)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>KNOCKKNOCK<|>ORGANIZATION<|>KnockKnock is a macOS application that scans for persistently installed software)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CLOUD API<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Cloud API is a set of protocols and tools for building software and applications for cloud environments)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AWS CLOUDWATCH<|>ORGANIZATION<|>AWS CloudWatch is a monitoring and observability service provided by Amazon Web Services)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AZURE VM AGENT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Azure VM Agent is a service that provides support for Azure virtual machines)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GOOGLE CLOUD MONITOR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Google Cloud Monitor is a service that provides monitoring and logging for Google Cloud Platform resources)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SECURITY SOFTWARE DISCOVERY<|>NETSH<|>Netsh can be used to obtain security software information during Security Software Discovery<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SECURITY SOFTWARE DISCOVERY<|>REG<|>Reg can be used to obtain security software information during Security Software Discovery<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SECURITY SOFTWARE DISCOVERY<|>CMD<|>Cmd can be used to obtain security software information during Security Software Discovery<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SECURITY SOFTWARE DISCOVERY<|>TASKLIST<|>Tasklist can be used to obtain security software information during Security Software Discovery<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SECURITY SOFTWARE DISCOVERY<|>LITTLESNITCH<|>LittleSnitch is a type of security software that adversaries may check for during Security Software Discovery<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SECURITY SOFTWARE DISCOVERY<|>KNOCKKNOCK<|>KnockKnock is a type of security software that adversaries may check for during Security Software Discovery<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SECURITY SOFTWARE DISCOVERY<|>CLOUD API<|>Cloud API can be used to discover cloud-native security software during Security Software Discovery<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CLOUD API<|>AWS CLOUDWATCH<|>AWS CloudWatch is a cloud-native security software that can be discovered using Cloud API<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CLOUD API<|>AZURE VM AGENT<|>Azure VM Agent is a cloud-native security software that can be discovered using Cloud API<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CLOUD API<|>GOOGLE CLOUD MONITOR<|>Google Cloud Monitor is a cloud-native security software that can be discovered using Cloud API<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
