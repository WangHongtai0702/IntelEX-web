SSL/TLS certificates are files that can be installed on servers to enable secure communications between systems. Digital certificates include information about the key, information about its owner's identity, and the digital signature of an entity that has verified the certificate's contents are correct. If the signature is valid, and the person examining the certificate trusts the signer, then they know they can use that key to communicate securely with its owner. Certificates can be uploaded to a server, then the server can be configured to use the certificate to enable encrypted communication with it.(Citation: DigiCert Install SSL Cert)\n\nAdversaries may install SSL/TLS certificates that can be used to further their operations, such as encrypting C2 traffic (ex: [Asymmetric Cryptography](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1573/002) with [Web Protocols](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1071/001)) or lending credibility to a credential harvesting site. Installation of digital certificates may take place for a number of server types, including web servers and email servers. \n\nAdversaries can obtain digital certificates (see [Digital Certificates](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1588/004)) or create self-signed certificates (see [Digital Certificates](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1587/003)). Digital certificates can then be installed on adversary controlled infrastructure that may have been acquired ([Acquire Infrastructure](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1583)) or previously compromised ([Compromise Infrastructure](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1584)).\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>DIGICERT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>DigiCert is a company that provides SSL/TLS certificates and offers guidance on their installation)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SSL/TLS CERTIFICATES<|>EVENT<|>SSL/TLS certificates are files installed on servers to enable secure communications between systems)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ASYMMETRIC CRYPTOGRAPHY<|>EVENT<|>Asymmetric Cryptography is a method used to encrypt C2 traffic, often in conjunction with web protocols)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WEB PROTOCOLS<|>EVENT<|>Web Protocols are used in conjunction with Asymmetric Cryptography to encrypt C2 traffic)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DIGITAL CERTIFICATES<|>EVENT<|>Digital certificates include information about the key, the owner's identity, and the digital signature of a verifying entity)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ACQUIRE INFRASTRUCTURE<|>EVENT<|>Acquire Infrastructure is a technique where adversaries obtain infrastructure to install digital certificates)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COMPROMISE INFRASTRUCTURE<|>EVENT<|>Compromise Infrastructure is a technique where adversaries use previously compromised infrastructure to install digital certificates)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DIGICERT<|>SSL/TLS CERTIFICATES<|>DigiCert provides SSL/TLS certificates and offers guidance on their installation<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SSL/TLS CERTIFICATES<|>ASYMMETRIC CRYPTOGRAPHY<|>SSL/TLS certificates can be used to encrypt C2 traffic using Asymmetric Cryptography<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SSL/TLS CERTIFICATES<|>WEB PROTOCOLS<|>SSL/TLS certificates can be used to encrypt C2 traffic using Web Protocols<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DIGITAL CERTIFICATES<|>ACQUIRE INFRASTRUCTURE<|>Digital certificates can be installed on infrastructure acquired by adversaries<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DIGITAL CERTIFICATES<|>COMPROMISE INFRASTRUCTURE<|>Digital certificates can be installed on previously compromised infrastructure<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
