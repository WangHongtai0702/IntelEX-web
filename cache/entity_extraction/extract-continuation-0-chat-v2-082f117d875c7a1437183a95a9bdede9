In Office 365 environments, adversaries may assign the Default or Anonymous user permissions or roles to the Top of Information Store (root), Inbox, or other mailbox folders. By assigning one or both user permissions to a folder, the adversary can utilize any other account in the tenant to maintain persistence to the target user’s mail folders.(Citation: Mandiant Defend UNC2452 White Paper)\n\nThis may be used in persistent threat incidents as well as BEC (Business Email Compromise) incidents where an adversary can add [Additional Cloud Roles](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1098/003) to the accounts they wish to compromise. This may further enable use of additional techniques for gaining access to systems. For example, compromised business accounts are often used to send messages to other accounts in the network of the target business while creating inbox rules (ex: [Internal Spearphishing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1534)), so the messages evade spam/phishing detection mechanisms.(Citation: Bienstock, D. - Defending O365 - 2019)\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>MICROSOFT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Microsoft is a technology company that provides the Add-MailboxPermission cmdlet in on-premises Exchange and Office 365)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FIREEYE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>FireEye is a cybersecurity company that reported on APT35 in 2018)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CROWDSTRIKE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>CrowdStrike is a cybersecurity company that published a report titled \"Hiding in Plain Sight\" in 2018)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GOOGLE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Google is a technology company that provides Google Workspace and Gmail, where delegation can be enabled via the Google Admin console)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MANDIANT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Mandiant is a cybersecurity company that published a white paper on defending against UNC2452)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UNC2452<|>ORGANIZATION<|>UNC2452 is a threat actor group that Mandiant has reported on)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>D.
