ListPlanting is a method of executing arbitrary code in the address space of a separate live process. Code executed via ListPlanting may also evade detection from security products since the execution is masked under a legitimate process.\n\nList-view controls are user interface windows used to display collections of items.(Citation: Microsoft List View Controls) Information about an application's list-view settings are stored within the process' memory in a <code>SysListView32</code> control.\n\nListPlanting (a form of message-passing \"shatter attack\") may be performed by copying code into the virtual address space of a process that uses a list-view control then using that code as a custom callback for sorting the listed items.(Citation: Modexp Windows Process Injection) Adversaries must first copy code into the target process’ memory space, which can be performed various ways including by directly obtaining a handle to the <code>SysListView32</code> child of the victim process window (via Windows API calls such as <code>FindWindow</code> and/or <code>EnumWindows</code>) or other [Process Injection](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1055) methods.\n\nSome variations of ListPlanting may allocate memory in the target process but then use window messages to copy the payload, to avoid the use of the highly monitored <code>WriteProcessMemory</code> function. For example, an adversary can use the <code>PostMessage</code> and/or <code>SendMessage</code> API functions to send <code>LVM_SETITEMPOSITION</code> and <code>LVM_GETITEMPOSITION</code> messages, effectively copying a payload 2 bytes at a time to the allocated memory.(Citation: ESET InvisiMole June 2020) \n\nFinally, the payload is triggered by sending the <code>LVM_SORTITEMS</code> message to the <code>SysListView32</code> child of the process window, with the payload within the newly allocated buffer passed and executed as the <code>ListView_SortItems</code> callback.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>LISTPLANTING<|>EVENT<|>ListPlanting is a method of executing arbitrary code in the address space of a separate live process, often used to evade detection from security products by masking execution under a legitimate process)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SYSLISTVIEW32<|>ORGANIZATION<|>SysListView32 is a control used in list-view settings within a process' memory, often targeted in ListPlanting attacks)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MICROSOFT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Microsoft is the developer of the List View Controls, which are user interface windows used to display collections of items)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MODEXP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Modexp is a source that provides information on Windows Process Injection techniques, including ListPlanting)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ESET<|>ORGANIZATION<|>ESET is a cybersecurity company that reported on the InvisiMole malware, which uses ListPlanting techniques)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INVISIMOLE<|>EVENT<|>InvisiMole is a malware that uses ListPlanting techniques to evade detection and execute arbitrary code)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LISTPLANTING<|>SYSLISTVIEW32<|>ListPlanting involves copying code into the virtual address space of a process that uses a SysListView32 control<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LISTPLANTING<|>MICROSOFT<|>ListPlanting exploits Microsoft List View Controls to execute arbitrary code<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LISTPLANTING<|>MODEXP<|>Modexp provides information on ListPlanting as a form of Windows Process Injection<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LISTPLANTING<|>ESET<|>ESET reported on the use of ListPlanting techniques in the InvisiMole malware<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LISTPLANTING<|>INVISIMOLE<|>InvisiMole uses ListPlanting techniques to evade detection and execute arbitrary code<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ESET<|>INVISIMOLE<|>ESET reported on the InvisiMole malware<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
