Windows uses access tokens to determine the ownership of a running process. A user can manipulate access tokens to make a running process appear as though it is the child of a different process or belongs to someone other than the user that started the process. When this occurs, the process also takes on the security context associated with the new token.\n\nAn adversary can use built-in Windows API functions to copy access tokens from existing processes; this is known as token stealing. These token can then be applied to an existing process (i.e. [Token Impersonation/Theft](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1134/001)) or used to spawn a new process (i.e. [Create Process with Token](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1134/002)). An adversary must already be in a privileged user context (i.e. administrator) to steal a token. However, adversaries commonly use token stealing to elevate their security context from the administrator level to the SYSTEM level. An adversary can then use a token to authenticate to a remote system as the account for that token if the account has appropriate permissions on the remote system.(Citation: Pentestlab Token Manipulation)\n\nAny standard user can use the <code>runas</code> command, and the Windows API functions, to create impersonation tokens; it does not require access to an administrator account. There are also other mechanisms, such as Active Directory fields, that can be used to modify access tokens.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>WINDOWS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Windows is an operating system that uses access tokens to determine the ownership of a running process)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ACCESS TOKENS<|>EVENT<|>Access tokens are used to determine the ownership and security context of a running process in Windows)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TOKEN STEALING<|>EVENT<|>Token stealing is a technique where adversaries copy access tokens from existing processes to elevate their security context)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TOKEN IMPERSONATION/THEFT<|>EVENT<|>Token Impersonation/Theft is a technique where stolen tokens are applied to an existing process or used to spawn a new process)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CREATE PROCESS WITH TOKEN<|>EVENT<|>Create Process with Token is a technique where a new process is spawned using a stolen token)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PENTESTLAB<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Pentestlab is a source that provides information on token manipulation techniques)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ACTIVE DIRECTORY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Active Directory is a directory service that can be used to modify access tokens)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WINDOWS<|>ACCESS TOKENS<|>Windows uses access tokens to determine the ownership and security context of a running process<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TOKEN STEALING<|>ACCESS TOKENS<|>Token stealing involves copying access tokens from existing processes<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TOKEN IMPERSONATION/THEFT<|>TOKEN STEALING<|>Token Impersonation/Theft is a technique that uses stolen tokens<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CREATE PROCESS WITH TOKEN<|>TOKEN STEALING<|>Create Process with Token is a technique that uses stolen tokens to spawn a new process<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PENTESTLAB<|>TOKEN STEALING<|>Pentestlab provides information on token stealing techniques<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ACTIVE DIRECTORY<|>ACCESS TOKENS<|>Active Directory can be used to modify access tokens<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
