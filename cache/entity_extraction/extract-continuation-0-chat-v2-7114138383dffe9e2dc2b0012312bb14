Adversaries may abuse email forwarding rules to monitor the activities of a victim, steal information, and further gain intelligence on the victim or the victim’s organization to use as part of further exploits or operations.(Citation: US-CERT TA18-068A 2018) Furthermore, email forwarding rules can allow adversaries to maintain persistent access to victim's emails even after compromised credentials are reset by administrators.(Citation: Pfammatter - Hidden Inbox Rules) Most email clients allow users to create inbox rules for various email functions, including forwarding to a different recipient. These rules may be created through a local email application, a web interface, or by command-line interface. Messages can be forwarded to internal or external recipients, and there are no restrictions limiting the extent of this rule. Administrators may also create forwarding rules for user accounts with the same considerations and outcomes.(Citation: Microsoft Tim McMichael Exchange Mail Forwarding 2)(Citation: Mac Forwarding Rules)\n\nAny user or administrator within the organization (or adversary with valid credentials) can create rules to automatically forward all received messages to another recipient, forward emails to different locations based on the sender, and more. Adversaries may also hide the rule by making use of the Microsoft Messaging API (MAPI) to modify the rule properties, making it hidden and not visible from Outlook, OWA or most Exchange Administration tools.(Citation: Pfammatter - Hidden Inbox Rules)\n\nIn some environments, administrators may be able to enable email forwarding rules that operate organization-wide rather than on individual inboxes. For example, Microsoft Exchange supports transport rules that evaluate all mail an organization receives against user-specified conditions, then performs a user-specified action on mail that adheres to those conditions.(Citation: Microsoft Mail Flow Rules 2023) Adversaries that abuse such features may be able to enable forwarding on all or specific mail an organization receives.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>US-CERT TA18-068A 2018<|>EVENT<|>A report or advisory issued by US-CERT in 2018 regarding email forwarding rules and their abuse by adversaries)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PFAMMATTER<|>PERSON<|>An individual or entity cited in relation to hidden inbox rules and email forwarding abuse)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MICROSOFT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A technology company that provides email clients and services, including Microsoft Exchange and Outlook)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TIM MCMICHAEL<|>PERSON<|>An individual associated with Microsoft, cited in relation to Exchange Mail Forwarding)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MAC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>An entity cited in relation to forwarding rules, likely referring to Apple Inc. or its products)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MICROSOFT EXCHANGE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>An email server solution provided by Microsoft that supports transport rules for email forwarding)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MAPI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Microsoft Messaging API, a protocol used to modify email rule properties)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OUTLOOK<|>ORGANIZATION<|>An email client provided by Microsoft, used for managing emails and inbox rules)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OWA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Outlook Web App, a web-based email client provided by Microsoft)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EXCHANGE ADMINISTRATION TOOLS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Tools provided by Microsoft for managing Exchange servers and email rules)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MICROSOFT MAIL FLOW RULES 2023<|>EVENT<|>A set of rules or guidelines provided by Microsoft in 2023 for managing email flow and forwarding within an organization)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PFAMMATTER<|>HIDDEN INBOX RULES<|>Pfammatter is cited in relation to hidden inbox rules and their abuse<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MICROSOFT<|>TIM MCMICHAEL<|>Tim McMichael is associated with Microsoft and cited in relation to Exchange Mail Forwarding<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MICROSOFT<|>MICROSOFT EXCHANGE<|>Microsoft provides the Exchange email server solution<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MICROSOFT<|>MAPI<|>Microsoft provides the Messaging API (MAPI) used to modify email rule properties<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MICROSOFT<|>OUTLOOK<|>Microsoft provides the Outlook email client<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MICROSOFT<|>OWA<|>Microsoft provides the Outlook Web App (OWA) email client<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MICROSOFT<|>EXCHANGE ADMINISTRATION TOOLS<|>Microsoft provides the Exchange Administration Tools<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MICROSOFT<|>MICROSOFT MAIL FLOW RULES 2023<|>Microsoft provided the Mail Flow Rules in 2023<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
