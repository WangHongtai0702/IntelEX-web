Process doppelgänging is a method of executing arbitrary code in the address space of a separate live process. \n\nWindows Transactional NTFS (TxF) was introduced in Vista as a method to perform safe file operations. (Citation: Microsoft TxF) To ensure data integrity, TxF enables only one transacted handle to write to a file at a given time. Until the write handle transaction is terminated, all other handles are isolated from the writer and may only read the committed version of the file that existed at the time the handle was opened. (Citation: Microsoft Basic TxF Concepts) To avoid corruption, TxF performs an automatic rollback if the system or application fails during a write transaction. (Citation: Microsoft Where to use TxF)\n\nAlthough deprecated, the TxF application programming interface (API) is still enabled as of Windows 10. (Citation: BlackHat Process Doppelgänging Dec 2017)\n\nAdversaries may abuse TxF to a perform a file-less variation of [Process Injection](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1055). Similar to [Process Hollowing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1055/012), process doppelgänging involves replacing the memory of a legitimate process, enabling the veiled execution of malicious code that may evade defenses and detection. Process doppelgänging's use of TxF also avoids the use of highly-monitored API functions such as <code>NtUnmapViewOfSection</code>, <code>VirtualProtectEx</code>, and <code>SetThreadContext</code>. (Citation: BlackHat Process Doppelgänging Dec 2017)\n\nProcess Doppelgänging is implemented in 4 steps (Citation: BlackHat Process Doppelgänging Dec 2017):\n\n* Transact – Create a TxF transaction using a legitimate executable then overwrite the file with malicious code. These changes will be isolated and only visible within the context of the transaction.\n* Load – Create a shared section of memory and load the malicious executable.\n* Rollback – Undo changes to original executable, effectively removing malicious code from the file system.\n* Animate – Create a process from the tainted section of memory and initiate execution.\n\nThis behavior will likely not result in elevated privileges since the injected process was spawned from (and thus inherits the security context) of the injecting process. However, execution via process doppelgänging may evade detection from security products since the execution is masked under a legitimate process.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>MICROSOFT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Microsoft is the company that introduced Windows Transactional NTFS (TxF) in Vista to perform safe file operations)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WINDOWS TRANSACTIONAL NTFS (TXF)<|>ORGANIZATION<|>TxF is a method introduced by Microsoft in Vista to ensure data integrity by enabling only one transacted handle to write to a file at a given time)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BLACKHAT<|>EVENT<|>BlackHat is a conference where the process doppelgänging technique was discussed in December 2017)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PROCESS DOPPELGÄNGING<|>EVENT<|>Process doppelgänging is a method of executing arbitrary code in the address space of a separate live process to evade process-based defenses and possibly elevate privileges)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PROCESS HOLLOWING<|>EVENT<|>Process hollowing is a technique similar to process doppelgänging that involves replacing the memory of a legitimate process to execute malicious code)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NTUNMAPVIEWOFSECTION<|>EVENT<|>NtUnmapViewOfSection is a highly-monitored API function that process doppelgänging avoids using)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VIRTUALPROTECTEX<|>EVENT<|>VirtualProtectEx is a highly-monitored API function that process doppelgänging avoids using)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SETTHREADCONTEXT<|>EVENT<|>SetThreadContext is a highly-monitored API function that process doppelgänging avoids using)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MICROSOFT<|>WINDOWS TRANSACTIONAL NTFS (TXF)<|>Microsoft introduced Windows Transactional NTFS (TxF) in Vista<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BLACKHAT<|>PROCESS DOPPELGÄNGING<|>Process doppelgänging was discussed at the BlackHat conference in December 2017<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PROCESS DOPPELGÄNGING<|>PROCESS HOLLOWING<|>Process doppelgänging is similar to process hollowing in that both involve replacing the memory of a legitimate process to execute malicious code<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PROCESS DOPPELGÄNGING<|>NTUNMAPVIEWOFSECTION<|>Process doppelgänging avoids using the highly-monitored API function NtUnmapViewOfSection<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PROCESS DOPPELGÄNGING<|>VIRTUALPROTECTEX<|>Process doppelgänging avoids using the highly-monitored API function VirtualProtectEx<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PROCESS DOPPELGÄNGING<|>SETTHREADCONTEXT<|>Process doppelgänging avoids using the highly-monitored API function SetThreadContext<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
