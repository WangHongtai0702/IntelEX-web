Native APIs provide a controlled means of calling low-level OS services within the kernel, such as those involving hardware/devices, memory, and processes.(Citation: NT API Windows)(Citation: Linux Kernel API) These native APIs are leveraged by the OS during system boot (when other system components are not yet initialized) as well as carrying out tasks and requests during routine operations.\n\nAdversaries may abuse these OS API functions as a means of executing behaviors. Similar to [Command and Scripting Interpreter](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059), the native API and its hierarchy of interfaces provide mechanisms to interact with and utilize various components of a victimized system.\n\nNative API functions (such as <code>NtCreateProcess</code>) may be directed invoked via system calls / syscalls, but these features are also often exposed to user-mode applications via interfaces and libraries.(Citation: OutFlank System Calls)(Citation: CyberBit System Calls)(Citation: MDSec System Calls) For example, functions such as the Windows API <code>CreateProcess()</code> or GNU <code>fork()</code> will allow programs and scripts to start other processes.(Citation: Microsoft CreateProcess)(Citation: GNU Fork) This may allow API callers to execute a binary, run a CLI command, load modules, etc. as thousands of similar API functions exist for various system operations.(Citation: Microsoft Win32)(Citation: LIBC)(Citation: GLIBC)\n\nHigher level software frameworks, such as Microsoft .NET and macOS Cocoa, are also available to interact with native APIs. These frameworks typically provide language wrappers/abstractions to API functionalities and are designed for ease-of-use/portability of code.(Citation: Microsoft NET)(Citation: Apple Core Services)(Citation: MACOS Cocoa)(Citation: macOS Foundation)\n\nAdversaries may use assembly to directly or in-directly invoke syscalls in an attempt to subvert defensive sensors and detection signatures such as user mode API-hooks.(Citation: Redops Syscalls) Adversaries may also attempt to tamper with sensors and defensive tools associated with API monitoring, such as unhooking monitored functions via [Disable or Modify Tools](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1562/001).\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>NT API WINDOWS<|>EVENT<|>A citation referring to the use of native APIs in Windows operating systems)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LINUX KERNEL API<|>EVENT<|>A citation referring to the use of native APIs in Linux operating systems)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OUTFLANK SYSTEM CALLS<|>EVENT<|>A citation referring to the use of system calls in OutFlank)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CYBERBIT SYSTEM CALLS<|>EVENT<|>A citation referring to the use of system calls in CyberBit)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MDSEC SYSTEM CALLS<|>EVENT<|>A citation referring to the use of system calls in MDSec)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MICROSOFT CREATEPROCESS<|>EVENT<|>A citation referring to the Windows API function CreateProcess())\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GNU FORK<|>EVENT<|>A citation referring to the GNU function fork())\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MICROSOFT WIN32<|>EVENT<|>A citation referring to the Microsoft Win32 API)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LIBC<|>EVENT<|>A citation referring to the standard C library)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GLIBC<|>EVENT<|>A citation referring to the GNU C Library)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MICROSOFT NET<|>EVENT<|>A citation referring to the Microsoft .NET framework)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>APPLE CORE SERVICES<|>EVENT<|>A citation referring to the Apple Core Services framework)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MACOS COCOA<|>EVENT<|>A citation referring to the macOS Cocoa framework)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MACOS FOUNDATION<|>EVENT<|>A citation referring to the macOS Foundation framework)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>REDOPS SYSCALLS<|>EVENT<|>A citation referring to the use of syscalls in Redops)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NT API WINDOWS<|>LINUX KERNEL API<|>Both citations refer to the use of native APIs in their respective operating systems<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>OUTFLANK SYSTEM CALLS<|>CYBERBIT SYSTEM CALLS<|>Both citations refer to the use of system calls in their respective contexts<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>OUTFLANK SYSTEM CALLS<|>MDSEC SYSTEM CALLS<|>Both citations refer to the use of system calls in their respective contexts<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CYBERBIT SYSTEM CALLS<|>MDSEC SYSTEM CALLS<|>Both citations refer to the use of system calls in their respective contexts<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MICROSOFT CREATEPROCESS<|>GNU FORK<|>Both citations refer to functions that allow programs and scripts to start other processes<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MICROSOFT WIN32<|>LIBC<|>Both citations refer to libraries that provide API functions for system operations<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MICROSOFT WIN32<|>GLIBC<|>Both citations refer to libraries that provide API functions for system operations<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LIBC<|>GLIBC<|>Both citations refer to standard C libraries<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MICROSOFT NET<|>APPLE CORE SERVICES<|>Both citations refer to higher level software frameworks<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MICROSOFT NET<|>MACOS COCOA<|>Both citations refer to higher level software frameworks<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MICROSOFT NET<|>MACOS FOUNDATION<|>Both citations refer to higher level software frameworks<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>APPLE CORE SERVICES<|>MACOS COCOA<|>Both citations refer to higher level software frameworks<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>APPLE CORE SERVICES<|>MACOS FOUNDATION<|>Both citations refer to higher level software frameworks<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MACOS COCOA<|>MACOS FOUNDATION<|>Both citations refer to higher level software frameworks<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>REDOPS SYSCALLS<|>OUTFLANK SYSTEM CALLS<|>Both citations refer to the use of syscalls<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>REDOPS SYSCALLS<|>CYBERBIT SYSTEM CALLS<|>Both citations refer to the use of syscalls<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>REDOPS SYSCALLS<|>MDSEC SYSTEM CALLS<|>Both citations refer to the use of syscalls<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
