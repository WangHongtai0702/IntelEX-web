Reflective loading involves allocating then executing payloads directly within the memory of the process, vice creating a thread or process backed by a file path on disk (e.g., [Shared Modules](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1129)).\n\nReflectively loaded payloads may be compiled binaries, anonymous files (only present in RAM), or just snubs of fileless executable code (ex: position-independent shellcode).(Citation: Introducing Donut)(Citation: S1 Custom Shellcode Tool)(Citation: Stuart ELF Memory)(Citation: 00sec Droppers)(Citation: Mandiant BYOL) For example, the `Assembly.Load()` method executed by [PowerShell](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/001) may be abused to load raw code into the running process.(Citation: Microsoft AssemblyLoad)\n\nReflective code injection is very similar to [Process Injection](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1055) except that the “injection” loads code into the processes’ own memory instead of that of a separate process. Reflective loading may evade process-based detections since the execution of the arbitrary code may be masked within a legitimate or otherwise benign process. Reflectively loading payloads directly into memory may also avoid creating files or other artifacts on disk, while also enabling malware to keep these payloads encrypted (or otherwise obfuscated) until execution.(Citation: Stuart ELF Memory)(Citation: 00sec Droppers)(Citation: Intezer ACBackdoor)(Citation: S1 Old Rat New Tricks)\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>DONUT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Donut is a tool referenced in the context of reflective loading of payloads into memory)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>S1 CUSTOM SHELLCODE TOOL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>S1 Custom Shellcode Tool is mentioned as a reference for reflective loading techniques)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STUART ELF MEMORY<|>PERSON<|>Stuart ELF Memory is cited in the context of reflective loading and memory techniques)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>00SEC DROPPERS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>00sec Droppers is referenced in the context of reflective loading and memory techniques)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MANDIANT BYOL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Mandiant BYOL is cited in the context of reflective loading techniques)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>POWERSHELL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>PowerShell is a scripting language and command-line shell that can be used to load raw code into a running process)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MICROSOFT ASSEMBLYLOAD<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Microsoft AssemblyLoad is a method that can be abused to load raw code into a running process)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INTEZER ACBACKDOOR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Intezer ACBackdoor is referenced in the context of reflective loading and memory techniques)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DONUT<|>REFLECTIVE LOADING<|>Donut is a tool used for reflective loading of payloads into memory<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>S1 CUSTOM SHELLCODE TOOL<|>REFLECTIVE LOADING<|>S1 Custom Shellcode Tool is used for reflective loading techniques<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>STUART ELF MEMORY<|>REFLECTIVE LOADING<|>Stuart ELF Memory is cited in the context of reflective loading and memory techniques<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>00SEC DROPPERS<|>REFLECTIVE LOADING<|>00sec Droppers is referenced in the context of reflective loading and memory techniques<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MANDIANT BYOL<|>REFLECTIVE LOADING<|>Mandiant BYOL is cited in the context of reflective loading techniques<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>POWERSHELL<|>REFLECTIVE LOADING<|>PowerShell can be used to load raw code into a running process<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MICROSOFT ASSEMBLYLOAD<|>REFLECTIVE LOADING<|>Microsoft AssemblyLoad is a method that can be abused to load raw code into a running process<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>INTEZER ACBACKDOOR<|>REFLECTIVE LOADING<|>Intezer ACBackdoor is referenced in the context of reflective loading and memory techniques<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
