The proc filesystem is a pseudo-filesystem used as an interface to kernel data structures for Linux based systems managing virtual memory. For each process, the `/proc/<PID>/maps` file shows how memory is mapped within the processâ€™s virtual address space. And `/proc/<PID>/mem`, exposed for debugging purposes, provides access to the processâ€™s virtual address space.(Citation: Picus Labs Proc cump 2022)(Citation: baeldung Linux proc map 2022)\n\nWhen executing with root privileges, adversaries can search these memory locations for all processes on a system that contain patterns indicative of credentials. Adversaries may use regex patterns, such as <code>grep -E \"^[0-9a-f-]* r\" /proc/\"$pid\"/maps | cut -d' ' -f 1</code>, to look for fixed strings in memory structures or cached hashes.(Citation: atomic-red proc file system) When running without privileged access, processes can still view their own virtual memory locations. Some services or programs may save credentials in clear text inside the processâ€™s memory.(Citation: MimiPenguin GitHub May 2017)(Citation: Polop Linux PrivEsc Gitbook)\n\nIf running as or with the permissions of a web browser, a process can search the `/maps` & `/mem` locations for common website credential patterns (that can also be used to find adjacent memory within the same structure) in which hashes or cleartext credentials may be located.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>PROC FILESYSTEM<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The proc filesystem is a pseudo-filesystem used as an interface to kernel data structures for Linux-based systems managing virtual memory)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PICUS LABS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Picus Labs is a research organization that published information about the proc filesystem in 2022)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BAELDUNG<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Baeldung is a platform that published information about the Linux proc map in 2022)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ATOMIC-RED<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Atomic-Red is a source that provided information about the proc file system)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MIMIPENGUIN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>MimiPenguin is a GitHub repository that published information about credentials in process memory in May 2017)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>POLOP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Polop is a source that provided information about Linux privilege escalation techniques)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PROC FILESYSTEM<|>PICUS LABS<|>Picus Labs published information about the proc filesystem in 2022<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PROC FILESYSTEM<|>BAELDUNG<|>Baeldung published information about the Linux proc map in 2022<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PROC FILESYSTEM<|>ATOMIC-RED<|>Atomic-Red provided information about the proc file system<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PROC FILESYSTEM<|>MIMIPENGUIN<|>MimiPenguin published information about credentials in process memory in May 2017<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PROC FILESYSTEM<|>POLOP<|>Polop provided information about Linux privilege escalation techniques<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
