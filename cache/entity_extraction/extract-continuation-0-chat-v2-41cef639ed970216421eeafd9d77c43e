The CLI is the primary means through which users and administrators interact with the device in order to view system information, modify device operations, or perform diagnostic and administrative functions. CLIs typically contain various permission levels required for different commands. \n\nScripting interpreters automate tasks and extend functionality beyond the command set included in the network OS. The CLI and scripting interpreter are accessible through a direct console connection, or through remote means, such as telnet or [SSH](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1021/004).\n\nAdversaries can use the network CLI to change how network devices behave and operate. The CLI may be used to manipulate traffic flows to intercept or manipulate data, modify startup configuration parameters to load malicious system software, or to disable security features or logging to avoid detection.(Citation: Cisco Synful Knock Evolution)\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>SCRIPTING<|>EVENT<|>The process of automating tasks and extending functionality beyond the command set included in the network OS)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COMMAND LINE INTERPRETER (CLI)<|>EVENT<|>The primary means through which users and administrators interact with network devices to view system information, modify device operations, or perform diagnostic and administrative functions)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TELNET<|>EVENT<|>A network protocol used to provide a command-line interface for communication with a remote device or server)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SSH<|>EVENT<|>A network protocol that provides a secure channel over an unsecured network in a client-server architecture)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CISCO SYNFUL KNOCK EVOLUTION<|>EVENT<|>A reference to a specific evolution of a malicious campaign targeting Cisco devices)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SCRIPTING<|>COMMAND LINE INTERPRETER (CLI)<|>Scripting interpreters automate tasks and extend functionality beyond the command set included in the network OS, which is accessed through the CLI<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TELNET<|>COMMAND LINE INTERPRETER (CLI)<|>The CLI is accessible through remote means such as telnet<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SSH<|>COMMAND LINE INTERPRETER (CLI)<|>The CLI is accessible through remote means such as SSH<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CISCO SYNFUL KNOCK EVOLUTION<|>COMMAND LINE INTERPRETER (CLI)<|>The Cisco Synful Knock Evolution is a reference to a malicious campaign that may involve the use of CLI to manipulate network devices<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
