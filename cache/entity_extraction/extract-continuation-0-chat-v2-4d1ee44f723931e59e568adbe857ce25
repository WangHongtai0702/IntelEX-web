These settings may include service quotas, subscription associations, tenant-wide policies, or other configurations that impact available compute. Such modifications may allow adversaries to abuse the victim’s compute resources to achieve their goals, potentially without affecting the execution of running instances and/or revealing their activities to the victim.\n\nFor example, cloud providers often limit customer usage of compute resources via quotas. Customers may request adjustments to these quotas to support increased computing needs, though these adjustments may require approval from the cloud provider. Adversaries who compromise a cloud environment may similarly request quota adjustments in order to support their activities, such as enabling additional [Resource Hijacking](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1496) without raising suspicion by using up a victim’s entire quota.(Citation: Microsoft Cryptojacking 2023) Adversaries may also increase allowed resource usage by modifying any tenant-wide policies that limit the sizes of deployed virtual machines.(Citation: Microsoft Azure Policy)\n\nAdversaries may also modify settings that affect where cloud resources can be deployed, such as enabling [Unused/Unsupported Cloud Regions](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1535). In Azure environments, an adversary who has gained access to a Global Administrator account may create new subscriptions in which to deploy resources, or engage in subscription hijacking by transferring an existing pay-as-you-go subscription from a victim tenant to an adversary-controlled tenant.(Citation: Microsoft Peach Sandstorm 2023) This will allow the adversary to use the victim’s compute resources without generating logs on the victim tenant.(Citation: Microsoft Azure Policy) (Citation: Microsoft Subscription Hijacking 2022)\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>MICROSOFT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Microsoft is a technology company that provides cloud services and has published information on various adversarial techniques)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AZURE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Azure is Microsoft's cloud computing service that can be targeted by adversaries for resource hijacking and subscription hijacking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GLOBAL ADMINISTRATOR<|>PERSON<|>A Global Administrator is a high-level account in Azure environments that can create new subscriptions and modify settings)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PEACH SANDSTORM<|>EVENT<|>Peach Sandstorm is an event or campaign related to adversarial activities in cloud environments, as cited by Microsoft in 2023)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SUBSCRIPTION HIJACKING<|>EVENT<|>Subscription Hijacking is an adversarial technique where an existing subscription is transferred from a victim tenant to an adversary-controlled tenant)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RESOURCE HIJACKING<|>EVENT<|>Resource Hijacking is an adversarial technique where compute resources are abused without raising suspicion)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UNUSED/UNSUPPORTED CLOUD REGIONS<|>EVENT<|>Unused/Unsupported Cloud Regions is an adversarial technique where cloud resources are deployed in regions that are not typically used or supported)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MICROSOFT CRYPTOJACKING 2023<|>EVENT<|>Microsoft Cryptojacking 2023 is a report or publication by Microsoft detailing cryptojacking activities in cloud environments)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MICROSOFT AZURE POLICY<|>EVENT<|>Microsoft Azure Policy is a set of guidelines and configurations for managing Azure environments, which can be modified by adversaries)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MICROSOFT SUBSCRIPTION HIJACKING 2022<|>EVENT<|>Microsoft Subscription Hijacking 2022 is a report or publication by Microsoft detailing subscription hijacking activities in cloud environments)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MICROSOFT<|>AZURE<|>Microsoft provides the Azure cloud computing service<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GLOBAL ADMINISTRATOR<|>AZURE<|>A Global Administrator can create new subscriptions and modify settings in Azure environments<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PEACH SANDSTORM<|>MICROSOFT<|>Peach Sandstorm is an event or campaign related to adversarial activities, as cited by Microsoft<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SUBSCRIPTION HIJACKING<|>AZURE<|>Subscription Hijacking is a technique used in Azure environments<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RESOURCE HIJACKING<|>AZURE<|>Resource Hijacking is a technique used in Azure environments<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>UNUSED/UNSUPPORTED CLOUD REGIONS<|>AZURE<|>Unused/Unsupported Cloud Regions is a technique used in Azure environments<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MICROSOFT CRYPTOJACKING 2023<|>MICROSOFT<|>Microsoft Cryptojacking 2023 is a report published by Microsoft<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MICROSOFT AZURE POLICY<|>MICROSOFT<|>Microsoft Azure Policy is a set of guidelines published by Microsoft<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MICROSOFT SUBSCRIPTION HIJACKING 2022<|>MICROSOFT<|>Microsoft Subscription Hijacking 2022 is a report published by Microsoft<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
