Spearphishing attachment is a specific variant of spearphishing. Spearphishing attachment is different from other forms of spearphishing in that it employs the use of malware attached to an email. All forms of spearphishing are electronically delivered social engineering targeted at a specific individual, company, or industry. In this scenario, adversaries attach a file to the spearphishing email and usually rely upon [User Execution](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1204) to gain execution.(Citation: Unit 42 DarkHydrus July 2018) Spearphishing may also involve social engineering techniques, such as posing as a trusted source.\n\nThere are many options for the attachment such as Microsoft Office documents, executables, PDFs, or archived files. Upon opening the attachment (and potentially clicking past protections), the adversary's payload exploits a vulnerability or directly executes on the user's system. The text of the spearphishing email usually tries to give a plausible reason why the file should be opened, and may explain how to bypass system protections in order to do so. The email may also contain instructions on how to decrypt an attachment, such as a zip file password, in order to evade email boundary defenses. Adversaries frequently manipulate file extensions and icons in order to make attached executables appear to be document files, or files exploiting one application appear to be a file for a different one.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>SPEARPHISHING<|>EVENT<|>Spearphishing is a form of electronically delivered social engineering targeted at a specific individual, company, or industry, often involving malicious attachments to gain access to victim systems)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SPEARPHISHING ATTACHMENT<|>EVENT<|>Spearphishing attachment is a specific variant of spearphishing that employs the use of malware attached to an email)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>USER EXECUTION<|>EVENT<|>User Execution is a technique where adversaries rely on the victim to execute a malicious payload, often by opening an attachment in a spearphishing email)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UNIT 42<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Unit 42 is a cybersecurity research team that reported on the DarkHydrus spearphishing campaign in July 2018)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DARKHYDRUS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>DarkHydrus is a threat actor group known for using spearphishing techniques to target victims)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SPEARPHISHING<|>SPEARPHISHING ATTACHMENT<|>Spearphishing attachment is a specific variant of spearphishing<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SPEARPHISHING<|>USER EXECUTION<|>Spearphishing often relies on User Execution to gain access to victim systems<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>UNIT 42<|>DARKHYDRUS<|>Unit 42 reported on the DarkHydrus spearphishing campaign<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
