This may include changing behaviors based on the results of checks for the presence of artifacts indicative of a virtual machine environment (VME) or sandbox. If the adversary detects a VME, they may alter their malware to disengage from the victim or conceal the core functions of the implant. They may also search for VME artifacts before dropping secondary or additional payloads. Adversaries may use the information learned from [Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1497) during automated discovery to shape follow-on behaviors.(Citation: Deloitte Environment Awareness)\n\nSpecific checks will vary based on the target and/or adversary, but may involve behaviors such as [Windows Management Instrumentation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1047), [PowerShell](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/001), [System Information Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1082), and [Query Registry](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1012) to obtain system information and search for VME artifacts. Adversaries may search for VME artifacts in memory, processes, file system, hardware, and/or the Registry. Adversaries may use scripting to automate these checks  into one script and then have the program exit if it determines the system to be a virtual environment. \n\nChecks could include generic system properties such as host/domain name and samples of network traffic. Adversaries may also check the network adapters addresses, CPU core count, and available memory/drive size. Once executed, malware may also use [File and Directory Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1083) to check if it was saved in a folder or file with unexpected or even analysis-related naming artifacts such as `malware`, `sample`, or `hash`.\n\nOther common checks may enumerate services running that are unique to these applications, installed programs on the system, manufacturer/product fields for strings relating to virtual machine applications, and VME-specific hardware/processor instructions.(Citation: McAfee Virtual Jan 2017) In applications like VMWare, adversaries can also use a special I/O port to send commands and receive output. \n \nHardware checks, such as the presence of the fan, temperature, and audio devices, could also be used to gather evidence that can be indicative a virtual environment. Adversaries may also query for specific readings from these devices.(Citation: Unit 42 OilRig Sept 2018)\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>DELOITTE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Deloitte is a multinational professional services network that provided information on environment awareness in the context of virtualization and sandbox evasion)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MCAFEE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>McAfee is a global computer security software company that provided information on virtualization checks in January 2017)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>UNIT 42<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Unit 42 is a cybersecurity research team that provided information on virtualization checks in September 2018)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VIRTUALIZATION/SANDBOX EVASION<|>EVENT<|>A technique used by adversaries to avoid detection by altering behaviors based on the presence of virtual machine environment artifacts)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WINDOWS MANAGEMENT INSTRUMENTATION<|>EVENT<|>A technique used by adversaries to obtain system information and search for VME artifacts)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>POWERSHELL<|>EVENT<|>A scripting language and command-line shell used by adversaries to obtain system information and search for VME artifacts)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SYSTEM INFORMATION DISCOVERY<|>EVENT<|>A technique used by adversaries to obtain system information and search for VME artifacts)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>QUERY REGISTRY<|>EVENT<|>A technique used by adversaries to obtain system information and search for VME artifacts)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FILE AND DIRECTORY DISCOVERY<|>EVENT<|>A technique used by adversaries to check if malware was saved in a folder or file with unexpected or analysis-related naming artifacts)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DELOITTE<|>VIRTUALIZATION/SANDBOX EVASION<|>Deloitte provided information on environment awareness in the context of virtualization and sandbox evasion<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MCAFEE<|>VIRTUALIZATION/SANDBOX EVASION<|>McAfee provided information on virtualization checks in January 2017<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>UNIT 42<|>VIRTUALIZATION/SANDBOX EVASION<|>Unit 42 provided information on virtualization checks in September 2018<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
