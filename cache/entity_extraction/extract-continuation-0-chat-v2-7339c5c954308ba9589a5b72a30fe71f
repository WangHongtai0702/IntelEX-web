This could include maliciously redirecting(Citation: Microsoft Lamin Sept 2017) or even disabling host-based sensors, such as Event Tracing for Windows (ETW)(Citation: Microsoft About Event Tracing 2018), by tampering settings that control the collection and flow of event telemetry.(Citation: Medium Event Tracing Tampering 2018) These settings may be stored on the system in configuration files and/or in the Registry as well as being accessible via administrative utilities such as [PowerShell](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/001) or [Windows Management Instrumentation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1047).\n\nFor example, adversaries may modify the `File` value in <code>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\EventLog\\Security</code> to hide their malicious actions in a new or different .evtx log file. This action does not require a system reboot and takes effect immediately.(Citation: disable_win_evt_logging) \n\nETW interruption can be achieved multiple ways, however most directly by defining conditions using the [PowerShell](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/001) <code>Set-EtwTraceProvider</code> cmdlet or by interfacing directly with the Registry to make alterations.\n\nIn the case of network-based reporting of indicators, an adversary may block traffic associated with reporting to prevent central analysis. This may be accomplished by many means, such as stopping a local process responsible for forwarding telemetry and/or creating a host-based firewall rule to block traffic to specific hosts responsible for aggregating events, such as security information and event management (SIEM) products.\n\nIn Linux environments, adversaries may disable or reconfigure log processing tools such as syslog or nxlog to inhibit detection and monitoring capabilities to facilitate follow on behaviors (Citation: LemonDuck).\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>MICROSOFT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Microsoft is a technology company that provides various software and hardware products, including Windows operating systems and Event Tracing for Windows (ETW))\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EVENT TRACING FOR WINDOWS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Event Tracing for Windows (ETW) is a high-performance, low-overhead, scalable tracing facility provided by Microsoft for Windows operating systems)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>POWERSHELL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>PowerShell is a task automation and configuration management framework from Microsoft, consisting of a command-line shell and associated scripting language)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WINDOWS MANAGEMENT INSTRUMENTATION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) is a set of specifications from Microsoft for consolidating the management of devices and applications in a network from Windows computing systems)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CURRENTCONTROLSET\\SERVICES\\EVENTLOG\\SECURITY<|>GEO<|>Registry path in Windows systems where event log settings are stored, which can be modified to hide malicious actions)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SIEM PRODUCTS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) products are tools that provide real-time analysis of security alerts generated by network hardware and applications)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SYSLOG<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Syslog is a standard for message logging that is used in Linux environments to collect and store log data)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NXLOG<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Nxlog is a multi-platform log management tool that can be used to collect, parse, and forward log data in Linux environments)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LEMONDUCK<|>ORGANIZATION<|>LemonDuck is a malware that targets Windows and Linux systems, often disabling or reconfiguring log processing tools to inhibit detection and monitoring capabilities)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MICROSOFT<|>EVENT TRACING FOR WINDOWS<|>Event Tracing for Windows (ETW) is a tracing facility provided by Microsoft<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MICROSOFT<|>POWERSHELL<|>PowerShell is a task automation and configuration management framework from Microsoft<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MICROSOFT<|>WINDOWS MANAGEMENT INSTRUMENTATION<|>Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) is a set of specifications from Microsoft<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MICROSOFT<|>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CURRENTCONTROLSET\\SERVICES\\EVENTLOG\\SECURITY<|>The registry path HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\EventLog\\Security is part of the Windows operating system developed by Microsoft<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MICROSOFT<|>SIEM PRODUCTS<|>SIEM products often integrate with Microsoft technologies for real-time analysis of security alerts<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SYSLOG<|>NXLOG<|>Syslog and Nxlog are both log management tools used in Linux environments<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LEMONDUCK<|>SYSLOG<|>LemonDuck malware may disable or reconfigure syslog to inhibit detection and monitoring capabilities<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LEMONDUCK<|>NXLOG<|>LemonDuck malware may disable or reconfigure nxlog to inhibit detection and monitoring capabilities<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
