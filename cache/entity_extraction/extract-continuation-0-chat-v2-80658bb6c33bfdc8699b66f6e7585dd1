Loadable Kernel Modules (LKMs) are pieces of code that can be loaded and unloaded into the kernel upon demand. They extend the functionality of the kernel without the need to reboot the system. For example, one type of module is the device driver, which allows the kernel to access hardware connected to the system.(Citation: Linux Kernel Programming) \n\nWhen used maliciously, LKMs can be a type of kernel-mode [Rootkit](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1014) that run with the highest operating system privilege (Ring 0).(Citation: Linux Kernel Module Programming Guide) Common features of LKM based rootkits include: hiding itself, selective hiding of files, processes and network activity, as well as log tampering, providing authenticated backdoors, and enabling root access to non-privileged users.(Citation: iDefense Rootkit Overview)\n\nKernel extensions, also called kext, are used in macOS to load functionality onto a system similar to LKMs for Linux. Since the kernel is responsible for enforcing security and the kernel extensions run as apart of the kernel, kexts are not governed by macOS security policies. Kexts are loaded and unloaded through <code>kextload</code> and <code>kextunload</code> commands. Kexts need to be signed with a developer ID that is granted privileges by Apple allowing it to sign Kernel extensions. Developers without these privileges may still sign kexts but they will not load unless SIP is disabled. If SIP is enabled, the kext signature is verified before being added to the AuxKC.(Citation: System and kernel extensions in macOS)\n\nSince macOS Catalina 10.15, kernel extensions have been deprecated in favor of System Extensions. However, kexts are still allowed as \"Legacy System Extensions\" since there is no System Extension for Kernel Programming Interfaces.(Citation: Apple Kernel Extension Deprecation)\n\nAdversaries can use LKMs and kexts to conduct [Persistence](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0003) and/or [Privilege Escalation](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0004) on a system. Examples have been found in the wild, and there are some relevant open source projects as well.(Citation: Volatility Phalanx2)(Citation: CrowdStrike Linux Rootkit)(Citation: GitHub Reptile)(Citation: GitHub Diamorphine)(Citation: RSAC 2015 San Francisco Patrick Wardle)(Citation: Synack Secure Kernel Extension Broken)(Citation: Securelist Ventir)(Citation: Trend Micro Skidmap)\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>LINUX KERNEL PROGRAMMING<|>EVENT<|>A reference to a citation that discusses Linux Kernel Programming)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LINUX KERNEL MODULE PROGRAMMING GUIDE<|>EVENT<|>A reference to a citation that discusses Linux Kernel Module Programming)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>IDEFENSE ROOTKIT OVERVIEW<|>EVENT<|>A reference to a citation that discusses rootkits)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SYSTEM AND KERNEL EXTENSIONS IN MACOS<|>EVENT<|>A reference to a citation that discusses system and kernel extensions in macOS)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>APPLE KERNEL EXTENSION DEPRECATION<|>EVENT<|>A reference to a citation that discusses the deprecation of kernel extensions by Apple)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VOLATILITY PHALANX2<|>EVENT<|>A reference to a citation that discusses an example of a rootkit found in the wild)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CROWDSTRIKE LINUX ROOTKIT<|>EVENT<|>A reference to a citation that discusses a Linux rootkit found by CrowdStrike)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GITHUB REPTILE<|>EVENT<|>A reference to a citation that discusses an open-source project related to rootkits)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GITHUB DIAMORPHINE<|>EVENT<|>A reference to a citation that discusses an open-source project related to rootkits)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RSAC 2015 SAN FRANCISCO PATRICK WARDLE<|>EVENT<|>A reference to a citation that discusses a presentation by Patrick Wardle at RSAC 2015 in San Francisco)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SYNACK SECURE KERNEL EXTENSION BROKEN<|>EVENT<|>A reference to a citation that discusses a secure kernel extension broken by Synack)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SECURELIST VENTIR<|>EVENT<|>A reference to a citation that discusses the Ventir rootkit)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TREND MICRO SKIDMAP<|>EVENT<|>A reference to a citation that discusses the Skidmap rootkit found by Trend Micro)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>APPLE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A technology company that grants developer IDs for signing kernel extensions)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CROWDSTRIKE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A cybersecurity company that found a Linux rootkit)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SYNACK<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A cybersecurity company that discussed a broken secure kernel extension)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TREND MICRO<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A cybersecurity company that found the Skidmap rootkit)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PATRICK WARDLE<|>PERSON<|>A security researcher who presented at RSAC 2015 in San Francisco)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>APPLE<|>APPLE KERNEL EXTENSION DEPRECATION<|>Apple deprecated kernel extensions in favor of System Extensions<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CROWDSTRIKE<|>CROWDSTRIKE LINUX ROOTKIT<|>CrowdStrike found a Linux rootkit<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SYNACK<|>SYNACK SECURE KERNEL EXTENSION BROKEN<|>Synack discussed a broken secure kernel extension<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TREND MICRO<|>TREND MICRO SKIDMAP<|>Trend Micro found the Skidmap rootkit<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PATRICK WARDLE<|>RSAC 2015 SAN FRANCISCO PATRICK WARDLE<|>Patrick Wardle presented at RSAC 2015 in San Francisco<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
