Linux distributions and macOS commonly use key-based authentication to secure the authentication process of SSH sessions for remote management. The <code>authorized_keys</code> file in SSH specifies the SSH keys that can be used for logging into the user account for which the file is configured. This file is usually found in the user's home directory under <code>&lt;user-home&gt;/.ssh/authorized_keys</code>.(Citation: SSH Authorized Keys) Users may edit the system’s SSH config file to modify the directives PubkeyAuthentication and RSAAuthentication to the value “yes” to ensure public key and RSA authentication are enabled. The SSH config file is usually located under <code>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</code>.\n\nAdversaries may modify SSH <code>authorized_keys</code> files directly with scripts or shell commands to add their own adversary-supplied public keys. In cloud environments, adversaries may be able to modify the SSH authorized_keys file of a particular virtual machine via the command line interface or rest API. For example, by using the Google Cloud CLI’s “add-metadata” command an adversary may add SSH keys to a user account.(Citation: Google Cloud Add Metadata)(Citation: Google Cloud Privilege Escalation) Similarly, in Azure, an adversary may update the authorized_keys file of a virtual machine via a PATCH request to the API.(Citation: Azure Update Virtual Machines) This ensures that an adversary possessing the corresponding private key may log in as an existing user via SSH.(Citation: Venafi SSH Key Abuse)(Citation: Cybereason Linux Exim Worm) It may also lead to privilege escalation where the virtual machine or instance has distinct permissions from the requesting user.\n\nWhere authorized_keys files are modified via cloud APIs or command line interfaces, an adversary may achieve privilege escalation on the target virtual machine if they add a key to a higher-privileged user. \n\nSSH keys can also be added to accounts on network devices, such as with the `ip ssh pubkey-chain` [Network Device CLI](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/008) command.(Citation: cisco_ip_ssh_pubkey_ch_cmd)\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>SSH<|>ORGANIZATION<|>SSH (Secure Shell) is a protocol used for secure remote management and authentication of sessions)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LINUX<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Linux is an open-source operating system commonly used for servers and other systems)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MACOS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>macOS is an operating system developed by Apple Inc. for its Mac computers)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GOOGLE CLOUD<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Google Cloud is a suite of cloud computing services offered by Google)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AZURE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Azure is a cloud computing service created by Microsoft for building, testing, deploying, and managing applications and services)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VENAFI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Venafi is a cybersecurity company that focuses on securing machine identities)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CYBEREASON<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Cybereason is a cybersecurity technology company that provides endpoint protection, detection, and response services)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CISCO<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Cisco is a multinational technology conglomerate that develops, manufactures, and sells networking hardware, software, telecommunications equipment, and other high-technology services and products)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EXIM WORM<|>EVENT<|>The Exim Worm is a type of malware that targets Linux systems, exploiting vulnerabilities in the Exim mail transfer agent)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SSH<|>LINUX<|>SSH is commonly used on Linux distributions for secure remote management<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SSH<|>MACOS<|>SSH is commonly used on macOS for secure remote management<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GOOGLE CLOUD<|>SSH<|>Google Cloud allows modification of SSH authorized_keys files via its CLI<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AZURE<|>SSH<|>Azure allows modification of SSH authorized_keys files via its API<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>VENAFI<|>SSH<|>Venafi has reported on SSH key abuse<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CYBEREASON<|>SSH<|>Cybereason has reported on the Exim Worm which targets SSH<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CISCO<|>SSH<|>Cisco provides commands for adding SSH keys to network devices<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EXIM WORM<|>LINUX<|>The Exim Worm targets Linux systems<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EXIM WORM<|>CYBEREASON<|>Cybereason has reported on the Exim Worm<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
