Plist files are structured metadata in key-value pairs formatted in XML based on Apple's Core Foundation DTD. Plist files can be saved in text or binary format.(Citation: fileinfo plist file description) \n\nAdversaries can modify key-value pairs in plist files to influence system behaviors, such as hiding the execution of an application (i.e. [Hidden Window](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1564/003)) or running additional commands for persistence (ex: [Launch Agent](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1543/001)/[Launch Daemon](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1543/004) or [Re-opened Applications](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1547/007)).\n\nFor example, adversaries can add a malicious application path to the `~/Library/Preferences/com.apple.dock.plist` file, which controls apps that appear in the Dock. Adversaries can also modify the <code>LSUIElement</code> key in an application’s <code>info.plist</code> file  to run the app in the background. Adversaries can also insert key-value pairs to insert environment variables, such as <code>LSEnvironment</code>, to enable persistence via [Dynamic Linker Hijacking](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/006).(Citation: wardle chp2 persistence)(Citation: eset_osx_flashback)\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>APPLE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Apple is the company that developed macOS and the Core Foundation DTD used for plist files)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MACOS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>macOS is the operating system developed by Apple that uses plist files for application properties and configuration settings)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PLIST FILES<|>EVENT<|>Plist files are structured metadata in key-value pairs formatted in XML based on Apple's Core Foundation DTD, used by macOS applications to store properties and configuration settings)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HIDDEN WINDOW<|>EVENT<|>Hidden Window is a technique where adversaries hide the execution of an application)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LAUNCH AGENT<|>EVENT<|>Launch Agent is a technique where adversaries run additional commands for persistence)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LAUNCH DAEMON<|>EVENT<|>Launch Daemon is a technique where adversaries run additional commands for persistence)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>RE-OPENED APPLICATIONS<|>EVENT<|>Re-opened Applications is a technique where adversaries run additional commands for persistence)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DYNAMIC LINKER HIJACKING<|>EVENT<|>Dynamic Linker Hijacking is a technique where adversaries enable persistence by inserting environment variables)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COM.APPLE.DOCK.PLIST<|>EVENT<|>com.apple.dock.plist is a plist file that controls apps appearing in the Dock)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LSUIELEMENT<|>EVENT<|>LSUIElement is a key in an application’s info.plist file that can be modified to run the app in the background)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LSEnvironment<|>EVENT<|>LSEnvironment is a key-value pair that can be inserted to enable persistence via Dynamic Linker Hijacking)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WARDLE<|>PERSON<|>Wardle is a person cited for information on persistence techniques)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ESET<|>ORGANIZATION<|>ESET is a cybersecurity company cited for information on the OSX Flashback malware)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OSX FLASHBACK<|>EVENT<|>OSX Flashback is a malware cited in the context of plist file modifications)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>APPLE<|>MACOS<|>Apple developed macOS, which uses plist files<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>APPLE<|>PLIST FILES<|>Apple's Core Foundation DTD is the basis for the XML format of plist files<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MACOS<|>PLIST FILES<|>macOS applications use plist files to store properties and configuration settings<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PLIST FILES<|>HIDDEN WINDOW<|>Adversaries can modify plist files to hide the execution of an application<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PLIST FILES<|>LAUNCH AGENT<|>Adversaries can modify plist files to run additional commands for persistence<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PLIST FILES<|>LAUNCH DAEMON<|>Adversaries can modify plist files to run additional commands for persistence<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PLIST FILES<|>RE-OPENED APPLICATIONS<|>Adversaries can modify plist files to run additional commands for persistence<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PLIST FILES<|>DYNAMIC LINKER HIJACKING<|>Adversaries can insert key-value pairs in plist files to enable persistence via Dynamic Linker Hijacking<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PLIST FILES<|>COM.APPLE.DOCK.PLIST<|>Adversaries can add a malicious application path to the com.apple.dock.plist file<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PLIST FILES<|>LSUIELEMENT<|>Adversaries can modify the LSUIElement key in an application’s info.plist file<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PLIST FILES<|>LSEnvironment<|>Adversaries can insert the LSEnvironment key-value pair to enable persistence<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WARDLE<|>PLIST FILES<|>Wardle is cited for information on plist file modifications for persistence<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ESET<|>OSX FLASHBACK<|>ESET is cited for information on the OSX Flashback malware<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>OSX FLASHBACK<|>PLIST FILES<|>OSX Flashback is a malware that involves plist file modifications<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
