Scripts and executables may contain variables names and other strings that help developers document code functionality. Symbols are often created by an operating systemâ€™s `linker` when executable payloads are compiled. Reverse engineers use these symbols and strings to analyze code and to identify functionality in payloads.(Citation: Mandiant golang stripped binaries explanation)(Citation: intezer stripped binaries elf files 2018)\n\nAdversaries may use stripped payloads in order to make malware analysis more difficult. For example, compilers and other tools may provide features to remove or obfuscate strings and symbols. Adversaries have also used stripped payload formats, such as run-only AppleScripts, a compiled and stripped version of [AppleScript](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/002), to evade detection and analysis. The lack of human-readable information may directly hinder detection and analysis of payloads.(Citation: SentinelLabs reversing run-only applescripts 2021)\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>MANDIANT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Mandiant is a cybersecurity firm that provides threat intelligence and incident response services)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INTEZER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Intezer is a cybersecurity company specializing in malware analysis and threat detection)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SENTINELLABS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>SentinelLabs is a cybersecurity research division of SentinelOne, focusing on threat intelligence and malware analysis)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GOLANG<|>EVENT<|>Golang is a programming language often used in the development of stripped binaries to evade detection)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>APPLE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Apple is a technology company that developed AppleScript, a scripting language used in macOS)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>APPLESCRIPT<|>EVENT<|>AppleScript is a scripting language created by Apple, often used in run-only formats to evade detection)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MANDIANT<|>GOLANG<|>Mandiant provided an explanation on stripped binaries in Golang<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>INTEZER<|>GOLANG<|>Intezer provided information on stripped binaries in ELF files<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SENTINELLABS<|>APPLESCRIPT<|>SentinelLabs provided information on reversing run-only AppleScripts<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>APPLE<|>APPLESCRIPT<|>Apple developed the AppleScript language<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
