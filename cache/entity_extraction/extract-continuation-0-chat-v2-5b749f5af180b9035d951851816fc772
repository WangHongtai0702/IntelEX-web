This includes compute service resources such as instances, virtual machines, and snapshots as well as resources of other services including the storage and database services.\n\nCloud providers offer methods such as APIs and commands issued through CLIs to serve information about infrastructure. For example, AWS provides a <code>DescribeInstances</code> API within the Amazon EC2 API that can return information about one or more instances within an account, the <code>ListBuckets</code> API that returns a list of all buckets owned by the authenticated sender of the request, the <code>HeadBucket</code> API to determine a bucket’s existence along with access permissions of the request sender, or the <code>GetPublicAccessBlock</code> API to retrieve access block configuration for a bucket.(Citation: Amazon Describe Instance)(Citation: Amazon Describe Instances API)(Citation: AWS Get Public Access Block)(Citation: AWS Head Bucket) Similarly, GCP's Cloud SDK CLI provides the <code>gcloud compute instances list</code> command to list all Google Compute Engine instances in a project (Citation: Google Compute Instances), and Azure's CLI command <code>az vm list</code> lists details of virtual machines.(Citation: Microsoft AZ CLI) In addition to API commands, adversaries can utilize open source tools to discover cloud storage infrastructure through [Wordlist Scanning](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1595/003).(Citation: Malwarebytes OSINT Leaky Buckets - Hioureas)\n\nAn adversary may enumerate resources using a compromised user's access keys to determine which are available to that user.(Citation: Expel IO Evil in AWS) The discovery of these available resources may help adversaries determine their next steps in the Cloud environment, such as establishing Persistence.(Citation: Mandiant M-Trends 2020)An adversary may also use this information to change the configuration to make the bucket publicly accessible, allowing data to be accessed without authentication. Adversaries have also may use infrastructure discovery APIs such as <code>DescribeDBInstances</code> to determine size, owner, permissions, and network ACLs of database resources. (Citation: AWS Describe DB Instances) Adversaries can use this information to determine the potential value of databases and discover the requirements to access them. Unlike in [Cloud Service Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1526), this technique focuses on the discovery of components of the provided services rather than the services themselves.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>AWS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a cloud service provider offering various APIs and services for infrastructure management, including EC2, S3, and database services)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GCP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Google Cloud Platform (GCP) is a cloud service provider offering tools like the Cloud SDK CLI for managing compute instances and other resources)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AZURE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Microsoft Azure is a cloud service provider offering CLI commands for managing virtual machines and other resources)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AMAZON EC2<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) is a web service that provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GOOGLE COMPUTE ENGINE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Google Compute Engine is a service that provides virtual machines running in Google's data centers)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MICROSOFT AZ CLI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Microsoft Azure Command-Line Interface (CLI) is a set of commands used to manage Azure resources)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EXPLOITATION OF INFRASTRUCTURE DISCOVERY APIS<|>EVENT<|>Adversaries may use APIs like DescribeDBInstances to discover and exploit cloud infrastructure resources)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PERSISTENCE<|>EVENT<|>Adversaries may use discovered cloud resources to establish persistence in the cloud environment)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WORDLIST SCANNING<|>EVENT<|>A technique used by adversaries to discover cloud storage infrastructure by scanning for common bucket names)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MALWAREBYTES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Malwarebytes is a cybersecurity company that has reported on the use of OSINT tools for discovering leaky cloud storage buckets)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MANDIANT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Mandiant is a cybersecurity firm that provides insights and reports on cloud security trends and adversary behaviors)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EXPEL IO<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Expel IO is a cybersecurity company that has reported on adversary activities in AWS environments)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AWS<|>AMAZON EC2<|>Amazon EC2 is a service provided by AWS for resizable compute capacity<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GCP<|>GOOGLE COMPUTE ENGINE<|>Google Compute Engine is a service provided by GCP for virtual machines<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AZURE<|>MICROSOFT AZ CLI<|>Microsoft AZ CLI is a command-line tool provided by Azure for managing resources<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EXPLOITATION OF INFRASTRUCTURE DISCOVERY APIS<|>AWS<|>Adversaries may exploit AWS APIs to discover and manipulate cloud resources<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EXPLOITATION OF INFRASTRUCTURE DISCOVERY APIS<|>GCP<|>Adversaries may exploit GCP APIs to discover and manipulate cloud resources<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EXPLOITATION OF INFRASTRUCTURE DISCOVERY APIS<|>AZURE<|>Adversaries may exploit Azure APIs to discover and manipulate cloud resources<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PERSISTENCE<|>EXPLOITATION OF INFRASTRUCTURE DISCOVERY APIS<|>Adversaries may use discovered resources to establish persistence in the cloud<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WORDLIST SCANNING<|>MALWAREBYTES<|>Malwarebytes has reported on the use of wordlist scanning to discover leaky cloud storage buckets<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PERSISTENCE<|>MANDIANT<|>Mandiant has reported on adversaries using discovered cloud resources to establish persistence<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EXPLOITATION OF INFRASTRUCTURE DISCOVERY APIS<|>EXPEL IO<|>Expel IO has reported on adversaries exploiting AWS infrastructure discovery APIs<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
