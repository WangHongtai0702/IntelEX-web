Conditional access policies are additional verifications used by identity providers and identity and access management systems to determine whether a user should be granted access to a resource.\n\nFor example, in Azure AD, Okta, and JumpCloud, users can be denied access to applications based on their IP address, device enrollment status, and use of multi-factor authentication.(Citation: Microsoft Conditional Access)(Citation: JumpCloud Conditional Access Policies)(Citation: Okta Conditional Access Policies) In some cases, identity providers may also support the use of risk-based metrics to deny sign-ins based on a variety of indicators. In AWS and GCP, IAM policies can contain `condition` attributes that verify arbitrary constraints such as the source IP, the date the request was made, and the nature of the resources or regions being requested.(Citation: AWS IAM Conditions)(Citation: GCP IAM Conditions) These measures help to prevent compromised credentials from resulting in unauthorized access to data or resources, as well as limit user permissions to only those required. \n\nBy modifying conditional access policies, such as adding additional trusted IP ranges, removing [Multi-Factor Authentication](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1556/006) requirements, or allowing additional [Unused/Unsupported Cloud Regions](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1535), adversaries may be able to ensure persistent access to accounts and circumvent defensive measures.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>AZURE AD<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Azure AD is a cloud-based identity and access management service provided by Microsoft, used to manage user access to applications and resources)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OKTA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Okta is an identity and access management service that provides secure access to applications and resources)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JUMPCLOUD<|>ORGANIZATION<|>JumpCloud is a cloud-based directory platform that provides identity and access management services)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AWS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>AWS (Amazon Web Services) is a comprehensive cloud computing platform provided by Amazon, offering a variety of services including identity and access management)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GCP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>GCP (Google Cloud Platform) is a suite of cloud computing services provided by Google, which includes identity and access management capabilities)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MICROSOFT CONDITIONAL ACCESS<|>EVENT<|>Microsoft Conditional Access refers to the policies and measures implemented by Microsoft to control access to resources based on various conditions)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JUMPCLOUD CONDITIONAL ACCESS POLICIES<|>EVENT<|>JumpCloud Conditional Access Policies are the rules and conditions set by JumpCloud to manage user access to applications and resources)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OKTA CONDITIONAL ACCESS POLICIES<|>EVENT<|>Okta Conditional Access Policies are the rules and conditions set by Okta to manage user access to applications and resources)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AWS IAM CONDITIONS<|>EVENT<|>AWS IAM Conditions are the attributes and constraints defined in AWS Identity and Access Management policies to control access to resources)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GCP IAM CONDITIONS<|>EVENT<|>GCP IAM Conditions are the attributes and constraints defined in Google Cloud Platform Identity and Access Management policies to control access to resources)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AZURE AD<|>MICROSOFT CONDITIONAL ACCESS<|>Azure AD uses Microsoft Conditional Access policies to manage user access to applications and resources<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>OKTA<|>OKTA CONDITIONAL ACCESS POLICIES<|>Okta uses its own Conditional Access Policies to manage user access to applications and resources<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JUMPCLOUD<|>JUMPCLOUD CONDITIONAL ACCESS POLICIES<|>JumpCloud uses its own Conditional Access Policies to manage user access to applications and resources<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AWS<|>AWS IAM CONDITIONS<|>AWS uses IAM Conditions to control access to resources based on various attributes and constraints<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GCP<|>GCP IAM CONDITIONS<|>GCP uses IAM Conditions to control access to resources based on various attributes and constraints<|>8)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
