With elevated permissions, adversaries can use features such as the `libpcap` library to open sockets and install filters to allow or disallow certain types of data to come through the socket. The filter may apply to all traffic passing through the specified network interface (or every interface if not specified). When the network interface receives a packet matching the filter criteria, additional actions can be triggered on the host, such as activation of a reverse shell.\n\nTo establish a connection, an adversary sends a crafted packet to the targeted host that matches the installed filter criteria.(Citation: haking9 libpcap network sniffing) Adversaries have used these socket filters to trigger the installation of implants, conduct ping backs, and to invoke command shells. Communication with these socket filters may also be used in conjunction with [Protocol Tunneling](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1572).(Citation: exatrack bpf filters passive backdoors)(Citation: Leonardo Turla Penquin May 2020)\n\nFilters can be installed on any Unix-like platform with `libpcap` installed or on Windows hosts using `Winpcap`.  Adversaries may use either `libpcap` with `pcap_setfilter` or the standard library function `setsockopt` with `SO_ATTACH_FILTER` options. Since the socket connection is not active until the packet is received, this behavior may be difficult to detect due to the lack of activity on a host, low CPU overhead, and limited visibility into raw socket usage.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>LIBPCAP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The `libpcap` library is used to open sockets and install filters to allow or disallow certain types of data to come through the socket)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WINPCAP<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Winpcap is a library used on Windows hosts to install filters on network sockets)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LEONARDO<|>PERSON<|>Leonardo is cited in the document for his work on Turla Penquin in May 2020)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TURLA PENQUIN<|>EVENT<|>Turla Penquin is an event or project mentioned in the document, associated with Leonardo and dated May 2020)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EXATRACK<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Exatrack is cited in the document for their work on BPF filters and passive backdoors)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HAKING9<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Haking9 is cited in the document for their work on `libpcap` network sniffing)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LIBPCAP<|>WINPCAP<|>Both `libpcap` and `Winpcap` are libraries used to install filters on network sockets<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LEONARDO<|>TURLA PENQUIN<|>Leonardo is associated with the Turla Penquin event in May 2020<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EXATRACK<|>BPF FILTERS<|>Exatrack is cited for their work on BPF filters<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HAKING9<|>LIBPCAP<|>Haking9 is cited for their work on `libpcap` network sniffing<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
