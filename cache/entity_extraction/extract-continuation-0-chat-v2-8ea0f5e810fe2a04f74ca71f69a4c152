Environmental keying uses cryptography to constrain execution or actions based on adversary supplied environment specific conditions that are expected to be present on the target. Environmental keying is an implementation of [Execution Guardrails](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1480) that utilizes cryptographic techniques for deriving encryption/decryption keys from specific types of values in a given computing environment.(Citation: EK Clueless Agents)\n\nValues can be derived from target-specific elements and used to generate a decryption key for an encrypted payload. Target-specific values can be derived from specific network shares, physical devices, software/software versions, files, joined AD domains, system time, and local/external IP addresses.(Citation: Kaspersky Gauss Whitepaper)(Citation: Proofpoint Router Malvertising)(Citation: EK Impeding Malware Analysis)(Citation: Environmental Keyed HTA)(Citation: Ebowla: Genetic Malware) By generating the decryption keys from target-specific environmental values, environmental keying can make sandbox detection, anti-virus detection, crowdsourcing of information, and reverse engineering difficult.(Citation: Kaspersky Gauss Whitepaper)(Citation: Ebowla: Genetic Malware) These difficulties can slow down the incident response process and help adversaries hide their tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs).\n\nSimilar to [Obfuscated Files or Information](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1027), adversaries may use environmental keying to help protect their TTPs and evade detection. Environmental keying may be used to deliver an encrypted payload to the target that will use target-specific values to decrypt the payload before execution.(Citation: Kaspersky Gauss Whitepaper)(Citation: EK Impeding Malware Analysis)(Citation: Environmental Keyed HTA)(Citation: Ebowla: Genetic Malware)(Citation: Demiguise Guardrail Router Logo) By utilizing target-specific values to decrypt the payload the adversary can avoid packaging the decryption key with the payload or sending it over a potentially monitored network connection. Depending on the technique for gathering target-specific values, reverse engineering of the encrypted payload can be exceptionally difficult.(Citation: Kaspersky Gauss Whitepaper) This can be used to prevent exposure of capabilities in environments that are not intended to be compromised or operated within.\n\nLike other [Execution Guardrails](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1480), environmental keying can be used to prevent exposure of capabilities in environments that are not intended to be compromised or operated within. This activity is distinct from typical [Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1497). While use of [Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1497) may involve checking for known sandbox values and continuing with execution only if there is no match, the use of environmental keying will involve checking for an expected target-specific value that must match for decryption and subsequent execution to be successful.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>KASPERSKY GAUSS WHITEPAPER<|>EVENT<|>The Kaspersky Gauss Whitepaper is a document that discusses the use of environmental keying in malware to evade detection and complicate reverse engineering efforts)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PROOFPOINT ROUTER MALVERTISING<|>EVENT<|>Proofpoint Router Malvertising is an event or study that highlights the use of environmental keying in malicious advertising campaigns targeting routers)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ENVIRONMENTAL KEYED HTA<|>EVENT<|>Environmental Keyed HTA refers to an event or technique involving the use of environmental keying in HTML Application (HTA) files to evade detection)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EBOWLA: GENETIC MALWARE<|>EVENT<|>Ebowla: Genetic Malware is a study or event that discusses the use of environmental keying in malware to generate decryption keys from target-specific values)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DEMIGUISE GUARDRAIL ROUTER LOGO<|>EVENT<|>Demiguise Guardrail Router Logo is an event or study that discusses the use of environmental keying in router-based malware to evade detection)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EXECUTION GUARDRAILS<|>EVENT<|>Execution Guardrails is a technique that involves using specific conditions to constrain the execution of malware to a target environment)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VIRTUALIZATION/SANDBOX EVASION<|>EVENT<|>Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion is a technique used by adversaries to detect and evade virtualized or sandboxed environments to avoid detection)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>KASPERSKY GAUSS WHITEPAPER<|>ENVIRONMENTAL KEYED HTA<|>Both the Kaspersky Gauss Whitepaper and Environmental Keyed HTA discuss the use of environmental keying in malware<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>KASPERSKY GAUSS WHITEPAPER<|>EBOWLA: GENETIC MALWARE<|>Both the Kaspersky Gauss Whitepaper and Ebowla: Genetic Malware discuss the use of environmental keying in malware<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>KASPERSKY GAUSS WHITEPAPER<|>DEMIGUISE GUARDRAIL ROUTER LOGO<|>Both the Kaspersky Gauss Whitepaper and Demiguise Guardrail Router Logo discuss the use of environmental keying in malware<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PROOFPOINT ROUTER MALVERTISING<|>ENVIRONMENTAL KEYED HTA<|>Both Proofpoint Router Malvertising and Environmental Keyed HTA discuss the use of environmental keying in malware<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PROOFPOINT ROUTER MALVERTISING<|>EBOWLA: GENETIC MALWARE<|>Both Proofpoint Router Malvertising and Ebowla: Genetic Malware discuss the use of environmental keying in malware<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PROOFPOINT ROUTER MALVERTISING<|>DEMIGUISE GUARDRAIL ROUTER LOGO<|>Both Proofpoint Router Malvertising and Demiguise Guardrail Router Logo discuss the use of environmental keying in malware<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ENVIRONMENTAL KEYED HTA<|>EBOWLA: GENETIC MALWARE<|>Both Environmental Keyed HTA and Ebowla: Genetic Malware discuss the use of environmental keying in malware<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ENVIRONMENTAL KEYED HTA<|>DEMIGUISE GUARDRAIL ROUTER LOGO<|>Both Environmental Keyed HTA and Demiguise Guardrail Router Logo discuss the use of environmental keying in malware<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EBOWLA: GENETIC MALWARE<|>DEMIGUISE GUARDRAIL ROUTER LOGO<|>Both Ebowla: Genetic Malware and Demiguise Guardrail Router Logo discuss the use of environmental keying in malware<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EXECUTION GUARDRAILS<|>ENVIRONMENTAL KEYED HTA<|>Environmental Keyed HTA is an implementation of Execution Guardrails<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EXECUTION GUARDRAILS<|>EBOWLA: GENETIC MALWARE<|>Ebowla: Genetic Malware is an implementation of Execution Guardrails<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EXECUTION GUARDRAILS<|>DEMIGUISE GUARDRAIL ROUTER LOGO<|>Demiguise Guardrail Router Logo is an implementation of Execution Guardrails<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EXECUTION GUARDRAILS<|>VIRTUALIZATION/SANDBOX EVASION<|>Execution Guardrails and Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion are both techniques used to evade detection, but they operate differently<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
