Endpoint systems may be compromised through browsing to adversary controlled sites, as in [Drive-by Compromise](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1189). In such cases, the user's web browser is typically targeted for exploitation (often not requiring any extra user interaction once landing on the site), but adversaries may also set up websites for non-exploitation behavior such as [Application Access Token](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1550/001). Prior to [Drive-by Compromise](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1189), adversaries must stage resources needed to deliver that exploit to users who browse to an adversary controlled site. Drive-by content can be staged on adversary controlled infrastructure that has been acquired ([Acquire Infrastructure](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1583)) or previously compromised ([Compromise Infrastructure](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1584)).\n\nAdversaries may upload or inject malicious web content, such as [JavaScript](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/007), into websites.(Citation: FireEye CFR Watering Hole 2012)(Citation: Gallagher 2015) This may be done in a number of ways, including:\n\n* Inserting malicious scripts into web pages or other user controllable web content such as forum posts\n* Modifying script files served to websites from publicly writeable cloud storage buckets\n* Crafting malicious web advertisements and purchasing ad space on a website through legitimate ad providers (i.e., [Malvertising](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1583/008))\n\nIn addition to staging content to exploit a user's web browser, adversaries may also stage scripting content to profile the user's browser (as in [Gather Victim Host Information](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1592)) to ensure it is vulnerable prior to attempting exploitation.(Citation: ATT ScanBox)\n\nWebsites compromised by an adversary and used to stage a drive-by may be ones visited by a specific community, such as government, a particular industry, or region, where the goal is to compromise a specific user or set of users based on a shared interest. This kind of targeted campaign is referred to a strategic web compromise or watering hole attack.\n\nAdversaries may purchase domains similar to legitimate domains (ex: homoglyphs, typosquatting, different top-level domain, etc.) during acquisition of infrastructure ([Domains](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1583/001)) to help facilitate [Drive-by Compromise](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1189).\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>DRIVE-BY COMPROMISE<|>EVENT<|>Drive-by Compromise is a technique where adversaries infect systems through normal web browsing without requiring extra user interaction)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>APPLICATION ACCESS TOKEN<|>EVENT<|>Application Access Token is a technique where adversaries set up websites for non-exploitation behavior)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ACQUIRE INFRASTRUCTURE<|>EVENT<|>Acquire Infrastructure is a technique where adversaries acquire infrastructure to stage drive-by content)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COMPROMISE INFRASTRUCTURE<|>EVENT<|>Compromise Infrastructure is a technique where adversaries use previously compromised infrastructure to stage drive-by content)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JAVASCRIPT<|>EVENT<|>JavaScript is a scripting language that adversaries may use to inject malicious content into websites)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MALVERTISING<|>EVENT<|>Malvertising is a technique where adversaries craft malicious web advertisements and purchase ad space on websites)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GATHER VICTIM HOST INFORMATION<|>EVENT<|>Gather Victim Host Information is a technique where adversaries profile a user's browser to ensure it is vulnerable before attempting exploitation)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STRATEGIC WEB COMPROMISE<|>EVENT<|>Strategic Web Compromise, also known as a watering hole attack, is a targeted campaign where adversaries compromise websites visited by a specific community to target specific users)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DOMAINS<|>EVENT<|>Domains is a technique where adversaries purchase domains similar to legitimate ones to facilitate Drive-by Compromise)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DRIVE-BY COMPROMISE<|>APPLICATION ACCESS TOKEN<|>Both techniques involve adversaries setting up websites, but Drive-by Compromise is for exploitation while Application Access Token is for non-exploitation behavior<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DRIVE-BY COMPROMISE<|>ACQUIRE INFRASTRUCTURE<|>Acquire Infrastructure is a prerequisite technique for staging drive-by content for Drive-by Compromise<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DRIVE-BY COMPROMISE<|>COMPROMISE INFRASTRUCTURE<|>Compromise Infrastructure is another method for staging drive-by content for Drive-by Compromise<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DRIVE-BY COMPROMISE<|>JAVASCRIPT<|>JavaScript can be used to inject malicious content as part of a Drive-by Compromise<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DRIVE-BY COMPROMISE<|>MALVERTISING<|>Malvertising is a method to deliver malicious content for Drive-by Compromise<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DRIVE-BY COMPROMISE<|>GATHER VICTIM HOST INFORMATION<|>Gather Victim Host Information is used to profile a user's browser before attempting a Drive-by Compromise<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DRIVE-BY COMPROMISE<|>STRATEGIC WEB COMPROMISE<|>Strategic Web Compromise is a targeted form of Drive-by Compromise aimed at specific communities<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DRIVE-BY COMPROMISE<|>DOMAINS<|>Domains are purchased to facilitate Drive-by Compromise by mimicking legitimate domains<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
