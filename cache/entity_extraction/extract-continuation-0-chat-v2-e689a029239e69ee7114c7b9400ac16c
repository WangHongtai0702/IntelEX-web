Exploitation of a vulnerability occurs when an adversary takes advantage of a programming error in a program, service, or within the operating system software or kernel itself to execute adversary-controlled code. Vulnerabilities may exist in defensive security software that can be used to disable or circumvent them.\n\nAdversaries may have prior knowledge through reconnaissance that security software exists within an environment or they may perform checks during or shortly after the system is compromised for [Security Software Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1518/001). The security software will likely be targeted directly for exploitation. There are examples of antivirus software being targeted by persistent threat groups to avoid detection.\n\nThere have also been examples of vulnerabilities in public cloud infrastructure of SaaS applications that may bypass defense boundaries (Citation: Salesforce zero-day in facebook phishing attack), evade security logs (Citation: Bypassing CloudTrail in AWS Service Catalog), or deploy hidden infrastructure.(Citation: GhostToken GCP flaw)\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ADVERSARIES<|>PERSON<|>Adversaries are individuals or groups that exploit system or application vulnerabilities to bypass security features and execute adversary-controlled code)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SECURITY SOFTWARE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Security software refers to defensive security programs that protect systems from vulnerabilities and adversary attacks)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PUBLIC CLOUD INFRASTRUCTURE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Public cloud infrastructure refers to cloud services provided by third-party vendors that can be exploited by adversaries to bypass defense boundaries)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SAAS APPLICATIONS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>SaaS applications are software as a service applications that can have vulnerabilities exploited by adversaries)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SALESFORCE ZERO-DAY<|>EVENT<|>Salesforce zero-day refers to a vulnerability in Salesforce that was exploited in a Facebook phishing attack)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CLOUDTRAIL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>CloudTrail is an AWS service that provides logging and monitoring of AWS account activity, which can be evaded by adversaries)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AWS SERVICE CATALOG<|>ORGANIZATION<|>AWS Service Catalog is a service that allows organizations to create and manage catalogs of IT services, which can be exploited by adversaries)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GHOSTTOKEN GCP FLAW<|>EVENT<|>GhostToken GCP flaw refers to a vulnerability in Google Cloud Platform that allows adversaries to deploy hidden infrastructure)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ADVERSARIES<|>SECURITY SOFTWARE<|>Adversaries target security software directly for exploitation to avoid detection<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ADVERSARIES<|>PUBLIC CLOUD INFRASTRUCTURE<|>Adversaries exploit vulnerabilities in public cloud infrastructure to bypass defense boundaries<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ADVERSARIES<|>SAAS APPLICATIONS<|>Adversaries exploit vulnerabilities in SaaS applications to bypass security features<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SALESFORCE ZERO-DAY<|>ADVERSARIES<|>Adversaries exploited a zero-day vulnerability in Salesforce in a Facebook phishing attack<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CLOUDTRAIL<|>ADVERSARIES<|>Adversaries evade security logs in CloudTrail<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AWS SERVICE CATALOG<|>ADVERSARIES<|>Adversaries exploit AWS Service Catalog to bypass security features<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GHOSTTOKEN GCP FLAW<|>ADVERSARIES<|>Adversaries exploit the GhostToken GCP flaw to deploy hidden infrastructure<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
