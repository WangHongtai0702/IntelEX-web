Cloud accounts are those created and configured by an organization for use by users, remote support, services, or for administration of resources within a cloud service provider or SaaS application. Cloud Accounts can exist solely in the cloud; alternatively, they may be hybrid-joined between on-premises systems and the cloud through syncing or federation with other identity sources such as Windows Active Directory. (Citation: AWS Identity Federation)(Citation: Google Federating GC)(Citation: Microsoft Deploying AD Federation)\n\nService or user accounts may be targeted by adversaries through [Brute Force](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1110), [Phishing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566), or various other means to gain access to the environment. Federated or synced accounts may be a pathway for the adversary to affect both on-premises systems and cloud environments - for example, by leveraging shared credentials to log onto [Remote Services](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1021). High privileged cloud accounts, whether federated, synced, or cloud-only, may also allow pivoting to on-premises environments by leveraging SaaS-based [Software Deployment Tools](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1072) to run commands on hybrid-joined devices.\n\nAn adversary may create long lasting [Additional Cloud Credentials](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1098/001) on a compromised cloud account to maintain persistence in the environment. Such credentials may also be used to bypass security controls such as multi-factor authentication. \n\nCloud accounts may also be able to assume [Temporary Elevated Cloud Access](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1548/005) or other privileges through various means within the environment. Misconfigurations in role assignments or role assumption policies may allow an adversary to use these mechanisms to leverage permissions outside the intended scope of the account. Such over privileged accounts may be used to harvest sensitive data from online storage accounts and databases through [Cloud API](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/009) or other methods.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>AWS IDENTITY FEDERATION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>AWS Identity Federation is a service provided by Amazon Web Services that allows users to federate identities from external sources to AWS)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GOOGLE FEDERATING GC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Google Federating GC refers to Google's service for federating identities to Google Cloud)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MICROSOFT DEPLOYING AD FEDERATION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Microsoft Deploying AD Federation is a service provided by Microsoft for federating Active Directory identities to cloud services)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BRUTE FORCE<|>EVENT<|>Brute Force is a technique used by adversaries to gain access to accounts by systematically trying various combinations of passwords)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PHISHING<|>EVENT<|>Phishing is a technique used by adversaries to deceive users into providing sensitive information, such as login credentials, through fraudulent means)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>REMOTE SERVICES<|>EVENT<|>Remote Services refer to services that allow users to access systems and resources over a network, often targeted by adversaries to gain unauthorized access)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SOFTWARE DEPLOYMENT TOOLS<|>EVENT<|>Software Deployment Tools are tools used to deploy software across multiple systems, which can be leveraged by adversaries to run commands on hybrid-joined devices)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ADDITIONAL CLOUD CREDENTIALS<|>EVENT<|>Additional Cloud Credentials refer to extra credentials created by adversaries on compromised cloud accounts to maintain persistence)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TEMPORARY ELEVATED CLOUD ACCESS<|>EVENT<|>Temporary Elevated Cloud Access refers to the temporary elevation of privileges within a cloud environment, which can be exploited by adversaries)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CLOUD API<|>EVENT<|>Cloud API refers to application programming interfaces provided by cloud services, which can be used by adversaries to harvest sensitive data)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>AWS IDENTITY FEDERATION<|>CLOUD ACCOUNTS<|>AWS Identity Federation allows cloud accounts to federate identities from external sources<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GOOGLE FEDERATING GC<|>CLOUD ACCOUNTS<|>Google Federating GC allows cloud accounts to federate identities to Google Cloud<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MICROSOFT DEPLOYING AD FEDERATION<|>CLOUD ACCOUNTS<|>Microsoft Deploying AD Federation allows cloud accounts to federate Active Directory identities<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BRUTE FORCE<|>SERVICE OR USER ACCOUNTS<|>Brute Force is a technique used to target service or user accounts<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PHISHING<|>SERVICE OR USER ACCOUNTS<|>Phishing is a technique used to target service or user accounts<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>REMOTE SERVICES<|>FEDERATED OR SYNCED ACCOUNTS<|>Federated or synced accounts may be used to log onto remote services<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SOFTWARE DEPLOYMENT TOOLS<|>HIGH PRIVILEGED CLOUD ACCOUNTS<|>High privileged cloud accounts may use software deployment tools to run commands on hybrid-joined devices<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ADDITIONAL CLOUD CREDENTIALS<|>COMPROMISED CLOUD ACCOUNT<|>Additional cloud credentials may be created on a compromised cloud account to maintain persistence<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TEMPORARY ELEVATED CLOUD ACCESS<|>CLOUD ACCOUNTS<|>Cloud accounts may assume temporary elevated cloud access<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CLOUD API<|>OVER PRIVILEGED ACCOUNTS<|>Over privileged accounts may use cloud API to harvest sensitive data<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
