TCC is a Privacy & Security macOS control mechanism used to determine if the running process has permission to access the data or services protected by TCC, such as screen sharing, camera, microphone, or Full Disk Access (FDA).\n\nWhen an application requests to access data or a service protected by TCC, the TCC daemon (`tccd`) checks the TCC database, located at `/Library/Application Support/com.apple.TCC/TCC.db` (and `~/` equivalent), for existing permissions. If permissions do not exist, then the user is prompted to grant permission. Once permissions are granted, the database stores the application's permissions and will not prompt the user again unless reset. For example, when a web browser requests permissions to the user's webcam, once granted the web browser may not explicitly prompt the user again.(Citation: welivesecurity TCC)\n\nAdversaries may manipulate the TCC database or otherwise abuse the TCC service to execute malicious content. This can be done in various ways, including using privileged system applications to execute malicious payloads or manipulating the database to grant their application TCC permissions. \n\nFor example, adversaries can use Finder, which has FDA permissions by default, to execute malicious [AppleScript](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/002) while preventing a user prompt. For a system without System Integrity Protection (SIP) enabled, adversaries have also manipulated the operating system to load an adversary controlled TCC database using environment variables and [Launchctl](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1569/001).(Citation: TCC macOS bypass)(Citation: TCC Database)\n\nAdversaries may also opt to instead inject code (e.g., [Process Injection](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1055)) into targeted applications with the desired TCC permissions.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>TRANSPARENCY, CONSENT, & CONTROL (TCC)<|>ORGANIZATION<|>TCC is a Privacy & Security macOS control mechanism used to determine if the running process has permission to access the data or services protected by TCC, such as screen sharing, camera, microphone, or Full Disk Access (FDA))\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TCC DAEMON (TCCD)<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The TCC daemon checks the TCC database for existing permissions when an application requests to access data or a service protected by TCC)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TCC DATABASE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The TCC database stores the application's permissions once granted and is located at `/Library/Application Support/com.apple.TCC/TCC.db` and its equivalent in the user's home directory)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FINDER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Finder is a macOS application with Full Disk Access (FDA) permissions by default, which can be used by adversaries to execute malicious AppleScript while preventing a user prompt)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SYSTEM INTEGRITY PROTECTION (SIP)<|>ORGANIZATION<|>SIP is a security feature of macOS that, when disabled, allows adversaries to manipulate the operating system to load an adversary-controlled TCC database using environment variables and Launchctl)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LAUNCHCTL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Launchctl is a macOS utility that can be used by adversaries to load an adversary-controlled TCC database when SIP is disabled)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>APPLE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Apple is the company that developed macOS and its associated security mechanisms like TCC and SIP)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MACOS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>macOS is the operating system developed by Apple that includes security features like TCC and SIP)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WELIVESECURITY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>WeLiveSecurity is a source that provided information on TCC)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TCC MACOS BYPASS<|>EVENT<|>An event where adversaries bypassed TCC security mechanisms on macOS)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TCC DATABASE<|>EVENT<|>An event where adversaries manipulated the TCC database to grant their application TCC permissions)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TRANSPARENCY, CONSENT, & CONTROL (TCC)<|>TCC DAEMON (TCCD)<|>The TCC daemon is part of the TCC service and checks the TCC database for permissions<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TRANSPARENCY, CONSENT, & CONTROL (TCC)<|>TCC DATABASE<|>The TCC database is a component of the TCC service that stores application permissions<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FINDER<|>TRANSPARENCY, CONSENT, & CONTROL (TCC)<|>Finder can be used to execute malicious AppleScript by abusing TCC permissions<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SYSTEM INTEGRITY PROTECTION (SIP)<|>TRANSPARENCY, CONSENT, & CONTROL (TCC)<|>SIP, when disabled, allows adversaries to manipulate the TCC database<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LAUNCHCTL<|>TRANSPARENCY, CONSENT, & CONTROL (TCC)<|>Launchctl can be used to load an adversary-controlled TCC database<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>APPLE<|>MACOS<|>Apple developed macOS<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>APPLE<|>TRANSPARENCY, CONSENT, & CONTROL (TCC)<|>Apple developed the TCC security mechanism<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>APPLE<|>SYSTEM INTEGRITY PROTECTION (SIP)<|>Apple developed the SIP security feature<|>10)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TCC MACOS BYPASS<|>TRANSPARENCY, CONSENT, & CONTROL (TCC)<|>The TCC macOS bypass event involved adversaries bypassing TCC security mechanisms<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TCC DATABASE<|>TRANSPARENCY, CONSENT, & CONTROL (TCC)<|>The TCC database event involved adversaries manipulating the TCC database<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WELIVESECURITY<|>TRANSPARENCY, CONSENT, & CONTROL (TCC)<|>WeLiveSecurity provided information on TCC<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
