Encrypting and/or encoding file content aims to conceal malicious artifacts within a file used in an intrusion. Many other techniques, such as [Software Packing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1027/002), [Steganography](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1027/003), and [Embedded Payloads](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1027/009), share this same broad objective. Encrypting and/or encoding files could lead to a lapse in detection of static signatures, only for this malicious content to be revealed (i.e., [Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1140)) at the time of execution/use.\n\nThis type of file obfuscation can be applied to many file artifacts present on victim hosts, such as malware log/configuration and payload files.(Citation: File obfuscation) Files can be encrypted with a hardcoded or user-supplied key, as well as otherwise obfuscated using standard encoding/compression schemes such as Base64.\n\nThe entire content of a file may be obfuscated, or just specific functions or values (such as C2 addresses). Encryption and encoding may also be applied in redundant layers for additional protection.\n\nFor example, adversaries may abuse password-protected Word documents or self-extracting (SFX) archives as a method of encrypting/encoding a file such as a [Phishing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566) payload. These files typically function by attaching the intended archived content to a decompressor stub that is executed when the file is invoked (e.g., [User Execution](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1204)).(Citation: SFX - Encrypted/Encoded File) \n\nAdversaries may also abuse file-specific as well as custom encoding schemes. For example, Byte Order Mark (BOM) headers in text files may be abused to manipulate and obfuscate file content until [Command and Scripting Interpreter](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059) execution.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>SOFTWARE PACKING<|>EVENT<|>A technique used to obfuscate code to impede detection by encrypting or encoding files, part of broader cybersecurity threats and measures)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STEGANOGRAPHY<|>EVENT<|>A technique for concealing files or information within other files, used to hide malicious content from detection mechanisms)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EMBEDDED PAYLOADS<|>EVENT<|>Malicious content embedded within files, which is concealed through encryption or encoding to avoid detection until execution)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DEOBFUSCATE/DECODE FILES OR INFORMATION<|>EVENT<|>The process of revealing concealed malicious content within a file at the time of its execution or use)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PHISHING<|>EVENT<|>A cyber attack technique that involves tricking the victim into revealing sensitive information or downloading malware, often through encrypted or encoded files)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>USER EXECUTION<|>EVENT<|>An event where the victim executes or opens a malicious file, leading to the potential compromise of the system)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BYTE ORDER MARK (BOM) HEADERS<|>EVENT<|>Headers in text files that can be abused by adversaries to manipulate and obfuscate file content until execution)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SOFTWARE PACKING<|>DEOBFUSCATE/DECODE FILES OR INFORMATION<|>Software Packing is a method that can be reversed or revealed by the process of Deobfuscating/Decoding Files or Information<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>STEGANOGRAPHY<|>DEOBFUSCATE/DECODE FILES OR INFORMATION<|>Steganography hides information that can be uncovered through Deobfuscating/Decoding Files or Information<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EMBEDDED PAYLOADS<|>DEOBFUSCATE/DECODE FILES OR INFORMATION<|>Embedded Payloads are concealed through encryption or encoding and can be revealed by Deobfuscating/Decoding Files or Information<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PHISHING<|>USER EXECUTION<|>Phishing often leads to User Execution when the victim is tricked into opening or executing a malicious file<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BYTE ORDER MARK (BOM) HEADERS<|>DEOBFUSCATE/DECODE FILES OR INFORMATION<|>BOM Headers manipulation is a specific case where file content obfuscation can be reversed by Deobfuscating/Decoding Files or Information<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
