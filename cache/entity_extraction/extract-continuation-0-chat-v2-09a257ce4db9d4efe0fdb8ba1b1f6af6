Process hollowing is a method of executing arbitrary code in the address space of a separate live process.  \n\nProcess hollowing is commonly performed by creating a process in a suspended state then unmapping/hollowing its memory, which can then be replaced with malicious code. A victim process can be created with native Windows API calls such as <code>CreateProcess</code>, which includes a flag to suspend the processes primary thread. At this point the process can be unmapped using APIs calls such as <code>ZwUnmapViewOfSection</code> or <code>NtUnmapViewOfSection</code>  before being written to, realigned to the injected code, and resumed via <code>VirtualAllocEx</code>, <code>WriteProcessMemory</code>, <code>SetThreadContext</code>, then <code>ResumeThread</code> respectively.(Citation: Leitch Hollowing)(Citation: Elastic Process Injection July 2017)\n\nThis is very similar to [Thread Local Storage](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1055/005) but creates a new process rather than targeting an existing process. This behavior will likely not result in elevated privileges since the injected process was spawned from (and thus inherits the security context) of the injecting process. However, execution via process hollowing may also evade detection from security products since the execution is masked under a legitimate process.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>PROCESS HOLLOWING<|>EVENT<|>Process hollowing is a method of executing arbitrary code in the address space of a separate live process by creating a process in a suspended state, unmapping its memory, and replacing it with malicious code)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WINDOWS API<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Windows API provides native calls such as CreateProcess, ZwUnmapViewOfSection, NtUnmapViewOfSection, VirtualAllocEx, WriteProcessMemory, SetThreadContext, and ResumeThread, which can be used in process hollowing)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LEITCH HOLLOWING<|>PERSON<|>Leitch Hollowing is cited as a source of information on process hollowing)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ELASTIC PROCESS INJECTION<|>EVENT<|>Elastic Process Injection is cited as a source of information on process injection techniques, including process hollowing)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PROCESS HOLLOWING<|>WINDOWS API<|>Process hollowing can be performed using various Windows API calls<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PROCESS HOLLOWING<|>LEITCH HOLLOWING<|>Leitch Hollowing is a cited source of information on process hollowing<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PROCESS HOLLOWING<|>ELASTIC PROCESS INJECTION<|>Elastic Process Injection is a cited source of information on process injection techniques, including process hollowing<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
