On Linux or macOS, when the setuid or setgid bits are set for an application binary, the application will run with the privileges of the owning user or group respectively.(Citation: setuid man page) Normally an application is run in the current user’s context, regardless of which user or group owns the application. However, there are instances where programs need to be executed in an elevated context to function properly, but the user running them may not have the specific required privileges.\n\nInstead of creating an entry in the sudoers file, which must be done by root, any user can specify the setuid or setgid flag to be set for their own applications (i.e. [Linux and Mac File and Directory Permissions Modification](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1222/002)). The <code>chmod</code> command can set these bits with bitmasking, <code>chmod 4777 [file]</code> or via shorthand naming, <code>chmod u+s [file]</code>. This will enable the setuid bit. To enable the setgid bit, <code>chmod 2775</code> and <code>chmod g+s</code> can be used.\n\nAdversaries can use this mechanism on their own malware to make sure they're able to execute in elevated contexts in the future.(Citation: OSX Keydnap malware) This abuse is often part of a \"shell escape\" or other actions to bypass an execution environment with restricted permissions.\n\nAlternatively, adversaries may choose to find and target vulnerable binaries with the setuid or setgid bits already enabled (i.e. [File and Directory Discovery](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1083)). The setuid and setguid bits are indicated with an \"s\" instead of an \"x\" when viewing a file's attributes via <code>ls -l</code>. The <code>find</code> command can also be used to search for such files. For example, <code>find / -perm +4000 2>/dev/null</code> can be used to find files with setuid set and <code>find / -perm +2000 2>/dev/null</code> may be used for setgid. Binaries that have these bits set may then be abused by adversaries.(Citation: GTFOBins Suid)\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>LINUX<|>GEO<|>An operating system where applications can have setuid or setgid bits set for privilege escalation)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MACOS<|>GEO<|>An operating system where applications can have setuid or setgid bits set for privilege escalation)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SETUID<|>EVENT<|>A Unix-based system feature allowing users to run an application with the privileges of the application's owner)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SETGID<|>EVENT<|>A Unix-based system feature allowing users to run an application with the privileges of the application's group owner)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SUDOERS FILE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A configuration file for the sudo command that specifies which users/groups can run what commands as what users/groups)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CHMOD<|>PERSON<|>A command in Unix and Unix-like operating systems that allows for changing the permissions of a file or directory)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OSX KEYDNAP MALWARE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Malware that exploits the setuid or setgid bits to execute in elevated contexts)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>FILE AND DIRECTORY DISCOVERY<|>EVENT<|>A technique used by adversaries to find files and directories of interest, potentially exploiting setuid and setgid bits)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SETUID<|>LINUX<|>The setuid bit is a feature in Linux for privilege escalation<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SETGID<|>LINUX<|>The setgid bit is a feature in Linux for privilege escalation<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SETUID<|>MACOS<|>The setuid bit is a feature in macOS for privilege escalation<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SETGID<|>MACOS<|>The setgid bit is a feature in macOS for privilege escalation<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHMOD<|>SETUID<|>The chmod command is used to set the setuid bit on files<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CHMOD<|>SETGID<|>The chmod command is used to set the setgid bit on files<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>OSX KEYDNAP MALWARE<|>SETUID<|>OSX Keydnap malware exploits the setuid bit for elevated execution<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>OSX KEYDNAP MALWARE<|>SETGID<|>OSX Keydnap malware may exploit the setgid bit for elevated execution<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FILE AND DIRECTORY DISCOVERY<|>SETUID<|>File and Directory Discovery technique can be used to find files with setuid set<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FILE AND DIRECTORY DISCOVERY<|>SETGID<|>File and Directory Discovery technique can be used to find files with setgid set<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
