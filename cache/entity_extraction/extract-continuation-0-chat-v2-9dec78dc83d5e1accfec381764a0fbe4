Encrypting and/or encoding file content aims to conceal malicious artifacts within a file used in an intrusion. Many other techniques, such as [Software Packing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1027/002), [Steganography](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1027/003), and [Embedded Payloads](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1027/009), share this same broad objective. Encrypting and/or encoding files could lead to a lapse in detection of static signatures, only for this malicious content to be revealed (i.e., [Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1140)) at the time of execution/use.\n\nThis type of file obfuscation can be applied to many file artifacts present on victim hosts, such as malware log/configuration and payload files.(Citation: File obfuscation) Files can be encrypted with a hardcoded or user-supplied key, as well as otherwise obfuscated using standard encoding/compression schemes such as Base64.\n\nThe entire content of a file may be obfuscated, or just specific functions or values (such as C2 addresses). Encryption and encoding may also be applied in redundant layers for additional protection.\n\nFor example, adversaries may abuse password-protected Word documents or self-extracting (SFX) archives as a method of encrypting/encoding a file such as a [Phishing](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1566) payload. These files typically function by attaching the intended archived content to a decompressor stub that is executed when the file is invoked (e.g., [User Execution](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1204)).(Citation: SFX - Encrypted/Encoded File) \n\nAdversaries may also abuse file-specific as well as custom encoding schemes. For example, Byte Order Mark (BOM) headers in text files may be abused to manipulate and obfuscate file content until [Command and Scripting Interpreter](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059) execution.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>SOFTWARE PACKING<|>EVENT<|>Software Packing is a technique used to obfuscate files by compressing and encrypting them to impede detection)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>STEGANOGRAPHY<|>EVENT<|>Steganography is a technique used to hide data within other non-suspicious files or media to avoid detection)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>EMBEDDED PAYLOADS<|>EVENT<|>Embedded Payloads refer to the technique of hiding malicious code within legitimate files to evade detection)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DEOBFUSCATE/DECODE FILES OR INFORMATION<|>EVENT<|>Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information is the process of revealing hidden or encoded malicious content at the time of execution or use)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PHISHING<|>EVENT<|>Phishing is a technique used to deceive individuals into providing sensitive information by disguising as a trustworthy entity)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>USER EXECUTION<|>EVENT<|>User Execution is a technique where the execution of malicious files is triggered by user actions, such as opening a file or clicking a link)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>COMMAND AND SCRIPTING INTERPRETER<|>EVENT<|>Command and Scripting Interpreter is a technique that involves executing commands or scripts to perform malicious activities)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SOFTWARE PACKING<|>ENCRYPTING/ENCODING FILES<|>Software Packing shares the same broad objective of obfuscating files to impede detection<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>STEGANOGRAPHY<|>ENCRYPTING/ENCODING FILES<|>Steganography shares the same broad objective of obfuscating files to impede detection<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EMBEDDED PAYLOADS<|>ENCRYPTING/ENCODING FILES<|>Embedded Payloads share the same broad objective of obfuscating files to impede detection<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DEOBFUSCATE/DECODE FILES OR INFORMATION<|>ENCRYPTING/ENCODING FILES<|>Deobfuscate/Decode Files or Information is the process that reveals the malicious content hidden by encrypting/encoding files<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PHISHING<|>ENCRYPTING/ENCODING FILES<|>Phishing payloads can be encrypted/encoded to evade detection<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>USER EXECUTION<|>ENCRYPTING/ENCODING FILES<|>User Execution is a method by which encrypted/encoded files are executed<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>COMMAND AND SCRIPTING INTERPRETER<|>ENCRYPTING/ENCODING FILES<|>Command and Scripting Interpreter can be used to execute obfuscated files<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
