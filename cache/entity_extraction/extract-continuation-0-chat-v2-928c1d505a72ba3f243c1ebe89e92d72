Spearphishing for information is an attempt to trick targets into divulging information, frequently credentials or other actionable information. Spearphishing for information frequently involves social engineering techniques, such as posing as a source with a reason to collect information (ex: [Impersonation](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1656)) and/or creating a sense of urgency or alarm for the recipient.\n\nAll forms of phishing are electronically delivered social engineering. In this scenario, adversaries use phone calls to elicit sensitive information from victims. Known as voice phishing (or \"vishing\"), these communications can be manually executed by adversaries, hired call centers, or even automated via robocalls. Voice phishers may spoof their phone number while also posing as a trusted entity, such as a business partner or technical support staff.(Citation: BOA Telephone Scams)\n\nVictims may also receive phishing messages that direct them to call a phone number (\"callback phishing\") where the adversary attempts to collect confidential information.(Citation: Avertium callback phishing)\n\nAdversaries may also use information from previous reconnaissance efforts (ex: [Search Open Websites/Domains](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1593) or [Search Victim-Owned Websites](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1594)) to tailor pretexts to be even more persuasive and believable for the victim.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ADVERSARIES<|>PERSON<|>Adversaries are individuals or groups that use voice communications to elicit sensitive information for targeting purposes)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SPEARPHISHING<|>EVENT<|>Spearphishing is an attempt to trick targets into divulging information, frequently credentials or other actionable information, often involving social engineering techniques)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VOICE PHISHING<|>EVENT<|>Voice phishing, also known as \"vishing,\" involves adversaries using phone calls to elicit sensitive information from victims, which can be manually executed, done by hired call centers, or automated via robocalls)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BOA TELEPHONE SCAMS<|>EVENT<|>BOA Telephone Scams are cited examples of voice phishing where adversaries spoof their phone number while posing as trusted entities)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AVERTIUM CALLBACK PHISHING<|>EVENT<|>Avertium callback phishing is a cited example where victims receive phishing messages directing them to call a phone number, where adversaries attempt to collect confidential information)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ADVERSARIES<|>SPEARPHISHING<|>Adversaries use spearphishing to trick targets into divulging sensitive information<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ADVERSARIES<|>VOICE PHISHING<|>Adversaries use voice phishing to elicit sensitive information from victims<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>VOICE PHISHING<|>BOA TELEPHONE SCAMS<|>BOA Telephone Scams are an example of voice phishing<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>VOICE PHISHING<|>AVERTIUM CALLBACK PHISHING<|>Avertium callback phishing is an example of voice phishing<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
