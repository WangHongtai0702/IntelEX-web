Pass the hash (PtH) is a method of authenticating as a user without having access to the user's cleartext password. This method bypasses standard authentication steps that require a cleartext password, moving directly into the portion of the authentication that uses the password hash.\n\nWhen performing PtH, valid password hashes for the account being used are captured using a [Credential Access](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/TA0006) technique. Captured hashes are used with PtH to authenticate as that user. Once authenticated, PtH may be used to perform actions on local or remote systems.\n\nAdversaries may also use stolen password hashes to \"overpass the hash.\" Similar to PtH, this involves using a password hash to authenticate as a user but also uses the password hash to create a valid Kerberos ticket. This ticket can then be used to perform [Pass the Ticket](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1550/003) attacks.(Citation: Stealthbits Overpass-the-Hash)\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>PASS THE HASH<|>EVENT<|>Pass the Hash (PtH) is a method of authenticating as a user without having access to the user's cleartext password, allowing adversaries to move laterally within an environment by bypassing normal system access controls)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CREDENTIAL ACCESS<|>EVENT<|>Credential Access is a technique used to capture valid password hashes for accounts, which can then be used in Pass the Hash attacks)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OVERPASS THE HASH<|>EVENT<|>Overpass the Hash is a method similar to Pass the Hash, where a password hash is used to authenticate as a user and create a valid Kerberos ticket for further attacks)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PASS THE TICKET<|>EVENT<|>Pass the Ticket is an attack technique where a valid Kerberos ticket is used to authenticate and perform actions on systems)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PASS THE HASH<|>CREDENTIAL ACCESS<|>Credential Access techniques are used to capture valid password hashes, which are then used in Pass the Hash attacks<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PASS THE HASH<|>OVERPASS THE HASH<|>Overpass the Hash is similar to Pass the Hash but also involves creating a valid Kerberos ticket<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>OVERPASS THE HASH<|>PASS THE TICKET<|>Overpass the Hash can be used to create a valid Kerberos ticket, which is then used in Pass the Ticket attacks<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
