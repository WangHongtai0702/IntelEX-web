Spearphishing via service is a specific variant of spearphishing. It is different from other forms of spearphishing in that it employs the use of third party services rather than directly via enterprise email channels. \n\nAll forms of spearphishing are electronically delivered social engineering targeted at a specific individual, company, or industry. In this scenario, adversaries send messages through various social media services, personal webmail, and other non-enterprise controlled services.(Citation: Lookout Dark Caracal Jan 2018) These services are more likely to have a less-strict security policy than an enterprise. As with most kinds of spearphishing, the goal is to generate rapport with the target or get the target's interest in some way. Adversaries will create fake social media accounts and message employees for potential job opportunities. Doing so allows a plausible reason for asking about services, policies, and software that's running in an environment. The adversary can then send malicious links or attachments through these services.\n\nA common example is to build rapport with a target via social media, then send content to a personal webmail service that the target uses on their work computer. This allows an adversary to bypass some email restrictions on the work account, and the target is more likely to open the file since it's something they were expecting. If the payload doesn't work as expected, the adversary can continue normal communications and troubleshoot with the target on how to get it working.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>LOOKOUT DARK CARACAL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Lookout Dark Caracal is an organization that published a report in January 2018 about spearphishing via third-party services)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SPEARPHISHING<|>EVENT<|>Spearphishing is an electronically delivered social engineering attack targeted at a specific individual, company, or industry)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>THIRD-PARTY SERVICES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Third-party services are non-enterprise controlled services used by adversaries to send spearphishing messages)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SOCIAL MEDIA<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Social media services are platforms used by adversaries to send spearphishing messages and build rapport with targets)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PERSONAL WEBMAIL<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Personal webmail services are used by adversaries to send malicious links or attachments to targets)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ENTERPRISE EMAIL CHANNELS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Enterprise email channels are official email systems of a company that are bypassed by using third-party services for spearphishing)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LOOKOUT DARK CARACAL<|>SPEARPHISHING<|>Lookout Dark Caracal published a report about spearphishing via third-party services<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SPEARPHISHING<|>THIRD-PARTY SERVICES<|>Spearphishing via service employs the use of third-party services<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SPEARPHISHING<|>SOCIAL MEDIA<|>Adversaries use social media services to send spearphishing messages<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SPEARPHISHING<|>PERSONAL WEBMAIL<|>Adversaries use personal webmail services to send malicious links or attachments<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SPEARPHISHING<|>ENTERPRISE EMAIL CHANNELS<|>Spearphishing via service bypasses enterprise email channels<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>THIRD-PARTY SERVICES<|>SOCIAL MEDIA<|>Social media is one of the third-party services used for spearphishing<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>THIRD-PARTY SERVICES<|>PERSONAL WEBMAIL<|>Personal webmail is one of the third-party services used for spearphishing<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>THIRD-PARTY SERVICES<|>ENTERPRISE EMAIL CHANNELS<|>Third-party services are used to bypass enterprise email channels<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SOCIAL MEDIA<|>PERSONAL WEBMAIL<|>Adversaries build rapport via social media and then send content to personal webmail<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
