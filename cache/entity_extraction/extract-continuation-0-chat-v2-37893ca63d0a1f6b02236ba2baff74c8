Similar to [DLL Search Order Hijacking](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/001), side-loading involves hijacking which DLL a program loads. But rather than just planting the DLL within the search order of a program then waiting for the victim application to be invoked, adversaries may directly side-load their payloads by planting then invoking a legitimate application that executes their payload(s).\n\nSide-loading takes advantage of the DLL search order used by the loader by positioning both the victim application and malicious payload(s) alongside each other. Adversaries likely use side-loading as a means of masking actions they perform under a legitimate, trusted, and potentially elevated system or software process. Benign executables used to side-load payloads may not be flagged during delivery and/or execution. Adversary payloads may also be encrypted/packed or otherwise obfuscated until loaded into the memory of the trusted process.(Citation: FireEye DLL Side-Loading)\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>FIREYE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>FireEye is a cybersecurity company that has documented techniques such as DLL side-loading used by adversaries)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DLL SIDE-LOADING<|>EVENT<|>DLL side-loading is a technique where adversaries plant a malicious DLL alongside a legitimate application to execute their payloads)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DLL SEARCH ORDER HIJACKING<|>EVENT<|>DLL Search Order Hijacking is a technique where adversaries manipulate the order in which DLLs are loaded by a program to execute malicious code)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>FIREYE<|>DLL SIDE-LOADING<|>FireEye has documented the technique of DLL side-loading<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DLL SIDE-LOADING<|>DLL SEARCH ORDER HIJACKING<|>DLL side-loading is similar to DLL Search Order Hijacking in that both involve manipulating which DLL a program loads<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
