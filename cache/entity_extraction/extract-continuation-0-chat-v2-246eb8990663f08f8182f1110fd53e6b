SSL/TLS certificates are designed to instill trust. They include information about the key, information about its owner's identity, and the digital signature of an entity that has verified the certificate's contents are correct. If the signature is valid, and the person examining the certificate trusts the signer, then they know they can use that key to communicate with its owner. In the case of self-signing, digital certificates will lack the element of trust associated with the signature of a third-party certificate authority (CA).\n\nAdversaries may create self-signed SSL/TLS certificates that can be used to further their operations, such as encrypting C2 traffic (ex: [Asymmetric Cryptography](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1573/002) with [Web Protocols](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1071/001)) or even enabling [Adversary-in-the-Middle](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1557) if added to the root of trust (i.e. [Install Root Certificate](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1553/004)).\n\nAfter creating a digital certificate, an adversary may then install that certificate (see [Install Digital Certificate](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1608/003)) on infrastructure under their control.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>SSL/TLS CERTIFICATES<|>EVENT<|>SSL/TLS certificates are digital certificates designed to instill trust by including information about the key, its owner's identity, and the digital signature of an entity that has verified the certificate's contents are correct)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SELF-SIGNED CERTIFICATES<|>EVENT<|>Self-signed certificates are digital certificates created by adversaries that lack the element of trust associated with the signature of a third-party certificate authority)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CERTIFICATE AUTHORITY (CA)<|>ORGANIZATION<|>A certificate authority (CA) is an entity that issues digital certificates and verifies the contents of the certificates to instill trust)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ADVERSARY<|>PERSON<|>An adversary is an entity that creates self-signed SSL/TLS certificates to further their operations, such as encrypting C2 traffic or enabling Adversary-in-the-Middle attacks)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>C2 TRAFFIC<|>EVENT<|>C2 traffic refers to command and control traffic that adversaries may encrypt using self-signed SSL/TLS certificates)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ADVERSARY-IN-THE-MIDDLE<|>EVENT<|>Adversary-in-the-Middle is an attack technique where adversaries intercept and potentially alter communications between two parties)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ROOT CERTIFICATE<|>EVENT<|>A root certificate is a digital certificate that is added to the root of trust, enabling various security operations)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INSTALL DIGITAL CERTIFICATE<|>EVENT<|>The process of installing a digital certificate on infrastructure under the control of an adversary)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ASYMMETRIC CRYPTOGRAPHY<|>EVENT<|>Asymmetric cryptography is a cryptographic technique that uses a pair of keys (public and private) for secure communication)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WEB PROTOCOLS<|>EVENT<|>Web protocols are protocols used for communication over the internet, which can be encrypted using SSL/TLS certificates)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ADVERSARY<|>SELF-SIGNED CERTIFICATES<|>Adversaries create self-signed certificates to further their operations<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SELF-SIGNED CERTIFICATES<|>C2 TRAFFIC<|>Self-signed certificates can be used to encrypt C2 traffic<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SELF-SIGNED CERTIFICATES<|>ADVERSARY-IN-THE-MIDDLE<|>Self-signed certificates can enable Adversary-in-the-Middle attacks<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SELF-SIGNED CERTIFICATES<|>ROOT CERTIFICATE<|>Self-signed certificates can be added to the root of trust<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ADVERSARY<|>INSTALL DIGITAL CERTIFICATE<|>Adversaries may install digital certificates on infrastructure under their control<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ASYMMETRIC CRYPTOGRAPHY<|>WEB PROTOCOLS<|>Asymmetric cryptography can be used with web protocols for secure communication<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CERTIFICATE AUTHORITY (CA)<|>SSL/TLS CERTIFICATES<|>Certificate authorities issue and verify SSL/TLS certificates<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
