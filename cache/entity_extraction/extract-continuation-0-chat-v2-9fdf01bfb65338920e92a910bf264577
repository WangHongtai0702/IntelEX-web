EWM injection is a method of executing arbitrary code in the address space of a separate live process. \n\nBefore creating a window, graphical Windows-based processes must prescribe to or register a windows class, which stipulate appearance and behavior (via windows procedures, which are functions that handle input/output of data).(Citation: Microsoft Window Classes) Registration of new windows classes can include a request for up to 40 bytes of EWM to be appended to the allocated memory of each instance of that class. This EWM is intended to store data specific to that window and has specific application programming interface (API) functions to set and get its value. (Citation: Microsoft GetWindowLong function) (Citation: Microsoft SetWindowLong function)\n\nAlthough small, the EWM is large enough to store a 32-bit pointer and is often used to point to a windows procedure. Malware may possibly utilize this memory location in part of an attack chain that includes writing code to shared sections of the process’s memory, placing a pointer to the code in EWM, then invoking execution by returning execution control to the address in the process’s EWM.\n\nExecution granted through EWM injection may allow access to both the target process's memory and possibly elevated privileges. Writing payloads to shared sections also avoids the use of highly monitored API calls such as <code>WriteProcessMemory</code> and <code>CreateRemoteThread</code>.(Citation: Elastic Process Injection July 2017) More sophisticated malware samples may also potentially bypass protection mechanisms such as data execution prevention (DEP) by triggering a combination of windows procedures and other system functions that will rewrite the malicious payload inside an executable portion of the target process.  (Citation: MalwareTech Power Loader Aug 2013) (Citation: WeLiveSecurity Gapz and Redyms Mar 2013)\n\nRunning code in the context of another process may allow access to the process's memory, system/network resources, and possibly elevated privileges. Execution via EWM injection may also evade detection from security products since the execution is masked under a legitimate process.\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>EXTRA WINDOW MEMORY<|>EVENT<|>Extra Window Memory (EWM) injection is a method of executing arbitrary code in the address space of a separate live process to evade process-based defenses and possibly elevate privileges)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MICROSOFT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Microsoft is the developer of the Windows operating system, which includes the functionality of window classes and EWM)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WINDOW CLASSES<|>EVENT<|>Window classes in Windows-based processes stipulate appearance and behavior, including the use of EWM for storing data specific to each window)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GETWINDOWLONG FUNCTION<|>EVENT<|>The GetWindowLong function is an API function provided by Microsoft to retrieve information about a window, including EWM)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SETWINDOWLONG FUNCTION<|>EVENT<|>The SetWindowLong function is an API function provided by Microsoft to set information about a window, including EWM)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>ELASTIC<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Elastic is a company that has provided research on process injection techniques, including EWM injection)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MALWARETECH<|>ORGANIZATION<|>MalwareTech is a cybersecurity research entity that has analyzed malware samples, including those using EWM injection)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WELIVESECURITY<|>ORGANIZATION<|>WeLiveSecurity is a cybersecurity research entity that has reported on malware such as Gapz and Redyms, which may use EWM injection)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>POWER LOADER<|>EVENT<|>Power Loader is a malware sample analyzed by MalwareTech that uses EWM injection to bypass protection mechanisms)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GAPZ<|>EVENT<|>Gapz is a malware sample reported by WeLiveSecurity that uses EWM injection as part of its attack chain)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>REDYMS<|>EVENT<|>Redyms is a malware sample reported by WeLiveSecurity that uses EWM injection as part of its attack chain)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EXTRA WINDOW MEMORY<|>MICROSOFT<|>Microsoft's Windows operating system includes the functionality of EWM<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WINDOW CLASSES<|>MICROSOFT<|>Microsoft's Windows operating system uses window classes to manage window appearance and behavior<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GETWINDOWLONG FUNCTION<|>MICROSOFT<|>The GetWindowLong function is an API function provided by Microsoft<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SETWINDOWLONG FUNCTION<|>MICROSOFT<|>The SetWindowLong function is an API function provided by Microsoft<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>EXTRA WINDOW MEMORY<|>WINDOW CLASSES<|>EWM is used in window classes to store data specific to each window<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GETWINDOWLONG FUNCTION<|>EXTRA WINDOW MEMORY<|>The GetWindowLong function retrieves information about EWM<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SETWINDOWLONG FUNCTION<|>EXTRA WINDOW MEMORY<|>The SetWindowLong function sets information about EWM<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ELASTIC<|>EXTRA WINDOW MEMORY<|>Elastic has provided research on EWM injection<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MALWARETECH<|>EXTRA WINDOW MEMORY<|>MalwareTech has analyzed malware samples using EWM injection<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WELIVESECURITY<|>EXTRA WINDOW MEMORY<|>WeLiveSecurity has reported on malware using EWM injection<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>POWER LOADER<|>MALWARETECH<|>MalwareTech analyzed the Power Loader malware, which uses EWM injection<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GAPZ<|>WELIVESECURITY<|>WeLiveSecurity reported on the Gapz malware, which uses EWM injection<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>REDYMS<|>WELIVESECURITY<|>WeLiveSecurity reported on the Redyms malware, which uses EWM injection<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
