Password policies are a way to enforce complex passwords that are difficult to guess or crack through [Brute Force](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1110). This information may help the adversary to create a list of common passwords and launch dictionary and/or brute force attacks which adheres to the policy (e.g. if the minimum password length should be 8, then not trying passwords such as 'pass123'; not checking for more than 3-4 passwords per account if the lockout is set to 6 as to not lock out accounts).\n\nPassword policies can be set and discovered on Windows, Linux, and macOS systems via various command shell utilities such as <code>net accounts (/domain)</code>, <code>Get-ADDefaultDomainPasswordPolicy</code>, <code>chage -l <username></code>, <code>cat /etc/pam.d/common-password</code>, and <code>pwpolicy getaccountpolicies</code> (Citation: Superuser Linux Password Policies) (Citation: Jamf User Password Policies). Adversaries may also leverage a [Network Device CLI](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1059/008) on network devices to discover password policy information (e.g. <code>show aaa</code>, <code>show aaa common-criteria policy all</code>).(Citation: US-CERT-TA18-106A)\n\nPassword policies can be discovered in cloud environments using available APIs such as <code>GetAccountPasswordPolicy</code> in AWS (Citation: AWS GetPasswordPolicy).\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>BRUTE FORCE<|>EVENT<|>Brute Force is a technique used to guess or crack passwords by trying many possible combinations)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WINDOWS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Windows is an operating system that allows setting and discovering password policies via command shell utilities)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LINUX<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Linux is an operating system that allows setting and discovering password policies via command shell utilities)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MACOS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>macOS is an operating system that allows setting and discovering password policies via command shell utilities)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>AWS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>AWS (Amazon Web Services) is a cloud service provider that allows discovering password policies using available APIs such as GetAccountPasswordPolicy)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>US-CERT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>US-CERT (United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team) provides cybersecurity information and resources, including advisories like TA18-106A)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SUPERUSER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Superuser is a platform that provides information on Linux password policies)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>JAMF<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Jamf is a company that provides management solutions for Apple devices, including user password policies)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BRUTE FORCE<|>WINDOWS<|>Brute Force attacks can be launched on Windows systems to guess or crack passwords<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BRUTE FORCE<|>LINUX<|>Brute Force attacks can be launched on Linux systems to guess or crack passwords<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BRUTE FORCE<|>MACOS<|>Brute Force attacks can be launched on macOS systems to guess or crack passwords<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BRUTE FORCE<|>AWS<|>Brute Force attacks can be launched on AWS cloud environments to guess or crack passwords<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>US-CERT<|>WINDOWS<|>US-CERT provides advisories and information on securing Windows systems<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>US-CERT<|>LINUX<|>US-CERT provides advisories and information on securing Linux systems<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>US-CERT<|>MACOS<|>US-CERT provides advisories and information on securing macOS systems<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SUPERUSER<|>LINUX<|>Superuser provides information on Linux password policies<|>5)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>JAMF<|>MACOS<|>Jamf provides management solutions and user password policies for macOS<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
