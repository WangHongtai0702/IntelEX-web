Installer packages are OS specific and contain the resources an operating system needs to install applications on a system. Installer packages can include scripts that run prior to installation as well as after installation is complete. Installer scripts may inherit elevated permissions when executed. Developers often use these scripts to prepare the environment for installation, check requirements, download dependencies, and remove files after installation.(Citation: Installer Package Scripting Rich Trouton)\n\nUsing legitimate applications, adversaries have distributed applications with modified installer scripts to execute malicious content. When a user installs the application, they may be required to grant administrative permissions to allow the installation. At the end of the installation process of the legitimate application, content such as macOS `postinstall` scripts can be executed with the inherited elevated permissions. Adversaries can use these scripts to execute a malicious executable or install other malicious components (such as a [Launch Daemon](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1543/004)) with the elevated permissions.(Citation: Application Bundle Manipulation Brandon Dalton)(Citation: wardle evilquest parti)(Citation: Windows AppleJeus GReAT)(Citation: Debian Manual Maintainer Scripts)\n\nDepending on the distribution, Linux versions of package installer scripts are sometimes called maintainer scripts or post installation scripts. These scripts can include `preinst`, `postinst`, `prerm`, `postrm` scripts and run as root when executed.\n\nFor Windows, the Microsoft Installer services uses `.msi` files to manage the installing, updating, and uninstalling of applications. These installation routines may also include instructions to perform additional actions that may be abused by adversaries.(Citation: Microsoft Installation Procedures)\n######################\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>RICH TROUTON<|>PERSON<|>Rich Trouton is cited as a source for information on installer package scripting)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BRANDON DALTON<|>PERSON<|>Brandon Dalton is cited as a source for information on application bundle manipulation)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WARDLE<|>PERSON<|>Wardle is cited as a source for information on evilquest)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GREAT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>GReAT is cited as a source for information on Windows AppleJeus)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>DEBIAN<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Debian is cited as a source for information on maintainer scripts in Linux distributions)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MICROSOFT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Microsoft is cited as a source for information on installation procedures for Windows)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LINUX<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Linux is an operating system that uses package installer scripts such as maintainer scripts or post installation scripts)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>WINDOWS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Windows is an operating system that uses Microsoft Installer services to manage applications)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MACOS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>macOS is an operating system that can execute postinstall scripts with elevated permissions)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>INSTALLER PACKAGE<|>EVENT<|>An installer package is used to trigger the execution of malicious content by adversaries)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>APPLICATION INSTALLATION<|>EVENT<|>The process of installing applications, which can be exploited by adversaries to execute malicious content)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>RICH TROUTON<|>INSTALLER PACKAGE<|>Rich Trouton is cited as a source for information on installer package scripting<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BRANDON DALTON<|>APPLICATION INSTALLATION<|>Brandon Dalton is cited as a source for information on application bundle manipulation<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>WARDLE<|>APPLICATION INSTALLATION<|>Wardle is cited as a source for information on evilquest<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>GREAT<|>APPLICATION INSTALLATION<|>GReAT is cited as a source for information on Windows AppleJeus<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>DEBIAN<|>LINUX<|>Debian provides information on maintainer scripts in Linux distributions<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MICROSOFT<|>WINDOWS<|>Microsoft provides information on installation procedures for Windows<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MACOS<|>APPLICATION INSTALLATION<|>macOS can execute postinstall scripts with elevated permissions during application installation<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
